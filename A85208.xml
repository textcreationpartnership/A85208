            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now this people of the Jewes, becauſe of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries, their contempt of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their ſlighting and miſuſing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c. Their Cities were taken, the Temple burned, their liberties confiſcated, themſelves baniſhed out of their countrey,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:121624:13"/> and deprived of the ordinances of their God, and the ſignes of his preſence; before they were rebellious: but now they ſought God a long time; they prayed, but God would not heare, In ſo much that many poore ſoules amongſt them were diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and almoſt ready to deſpaire; That had not the Lord put in ſome incklings of hope, they had utterly fainted. Now whilſt theſe poore ſoules were praying and crying, and groaning, and now ready to give over for diſcouragement that God will not hear them, preſently the Lord flings in comfort, and beckens to their hearts not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, but to pray on and feare not. <hi>Thou dreweſt near in the day that I called upon thee, thou ſaidſt feare not;</hi> the words containe in them three properties of effectuall prayer.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:121624:13"/> thouſands of ſupplications and prayers as one ſuite; never had they done their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers till God did heare them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That an effectuall prayer is an unſatiable prayer,</hi> A man that prayes effectually, ſets down this in himſelf as his firſt concluſion never to ceaſe, nor to give over praying till he ſpeed: This is the firſt and prime thing that a godly heart lookes at, as <hi>David</hi> in his prayers: He begins in this manner, <hi>Heare my crie O God, attend unto my prayer. Pſal.</hi> 61. 1. So, <hi>Give eare unto my prayer O God, and hide not thy ſelfe from my ſupplications,</hi> Pſal. 55. 1. <hi>Hear my voyce O God in my prayer,</hi> Pſal. 64. 1. As if he ſhould ſay, Lord, now I come to call upon thee: now that I come to thee, to begge theſe and theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that my ſoule wants, I beſeech thee to heare me: for I am reſolved never to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:121624:14"/> my ſuit, never to give thee reſt, but for to continue my prayers and ſupplications, till thou give a gratious anſwer to my ſoul and heare me.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt and prime thing that the ſoule looks after, it being the very end of prayer to be heard; it is not with prayer as with Oratory; the end of oratory is not to perſwade, but to ſpeake perſwaſively; for a man may uſe all the perſwaſions that may be, and uſe all the perſwaſive arguments that the wit of man can invent, and ſpeake as cuttingly, as perſwaſively as may be, and yet the heart may be ſo intractable as not to be perſwaded; it is not ſo with prayer.</p>
                  <p>The end of prayer is to prevaile with God. Beloved, there is difference between the end and office of prayer; the office of prayer is to pray, the end of prayer is to prevaile. There is many a man that doth the office of prayer, and yet never gets the end of prayer. A man hath never gotten the end of his prayers, till he hath gotten that he prayed for. It is not with prayer as with a Phyſician, that may give the beſt phyſick under heaven, and yet the Patient may die under his hands; and therefore one gives counſell that a Phyſician never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with a deſperate man.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:121624:14"/>
                  <p>But if the ſoule be an effectuall ſuitor with God, it can never faile of its ſuite, becauſe it is an unſatiable Suitor, that never leaves his prayer till it terminates the end of it. I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. <hi>Selah. Jerom</hi> tranſlates it for ever. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 4. never doth a child of God pray, but he prayeth ſo as that his praier and Gods eare may be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together; I cried unto the Lord, and the Lord heard me: This alſo ſheweth how the Prophet cried and praied, namely ſo as his crying and Gods hearing were coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But ſome may object, How can a <label type="milestone">

God calls men to other duties of his worſhippe, and of his owne particular calling; after morning I muſt have done till noone, after noone I muſt have done till night: whether God heare me or no, muſt I be alwaies a praying till I ſpeed? then I ſhould doe nothing elſe but pray; how then are we to continue our praiers till God heare us, and give the grace that we pray for? to this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>A man muſt give over the words and <label type="milestone">

                     </label> times of prayer for other duties, but a man muſt not give over the ſuite of prayer. A poore begger comes to a houſekeepers gate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121624:15"/> and begs, but none heares him; now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a poore man, hath ſomething elſe to doe, and therefore he ſits downe or ſtands and knits or patches, and then he begs or knocks, and then to his work again; though he do not alwaies continue knocking or begging, yet he alwaies continues his ſuite: O that my ſuite might be granted me, or that I might have an almes here; ſo when the ſoul is begging of any grace, though it doth not alwaies continue the words of praier, yet it alwaies continues the ſuite of praier. <hi>David he would dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever. Pſal.</hi> 23. 6. A wicked man it may be will turne into Gods houſe and ſay a prayer, &amp;c. but the Prophet would (and ſo all godly men muſt) dwell there for ever; his ſoule lyeth alwaies at the throne of grace begging for grace. A wicked man he prayeth as the cock croweth; the cocke crowes and ceaſeth, and crowes again and ceaſeth again; and thinkes not of crowing til he crowes again: ſo a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man praies and ceaſeth, prayes and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth againe; his minde is never buſied to thinke whether his prayers ſpeede or no; he thinkes it is good Religion for him to pray, and therefore he takes that for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his praiers ſpeede, though in very deed God never heares his praiers, nor no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:121624:15"/> more reſpects it, then he reſpects the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Oxen, or the gruntling of hoggs: he is found in his prayers as the wilde Aſſe in her months: <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. The wilde Aſſe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the childe of God what ever he ailes, he goes with his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition preſently to the throne of grace, and there he never removes till he hath it grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as here we ſee the prayers of the Church conſiſting of many yeares, yet are counted but one ſuite; try therefore and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin whether thy praiers be unſatiable prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers yea or no; and for helpe herein take theſe markes; firſt if thy prayers be unſatiable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> praiers, then it is a begging praier; thou prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as if thou hadſt never praied before, as if thou hadſt never begun to pray, and thou never thinkeſt that thou haſt done any thing till thou haſt done the deede.

                  <p>But a godly man he will be alwaies cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God. Beloved, there is a beginning <hi>to</hi> an action, and a beginning <hi>of</hi> an action; thou never beginneſt to lift up a weight till thou ſtirreſt it from ground; indeede thou mayſt begin towards the action by pulling at it, by reaching at it; but thou never begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt the lifting up of the weight til thou ſtir it from its place: thou mayſt give a pull at prayer, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ugge at a grace, but thou haſt not ſo much as begun that duty, till thou ſeeſt God begin to hear thee, till thou ſeeſt the grace a coming; therefore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> when he prayed and had not that he prayed for, his prayers returned into his owne boſome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 13. there to lie to be a continuall ſuite unto God. A wicked
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:121624:16"/> man praies, and he leaves his praier behind him in his pew, or in his hal, or chamber; but a godly man praies and his prayer is in his heart, his praier is not out til the grace be in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly an unſatiable prayer, it is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more a proceeding prayer; you would think that theſe are two contraries and one oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the other, but they are not, only they are two ſeverall things: as it is ever a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning praier, becauſe in his own thoughts he reckons or thinkes that he hath nothing till he ſpeedes; ſo the ſoule that is unſatiable in praier, he proceedes, he gets neere to God, he gaines ſomthing, he windes up his heart higher, or ſomthing or other he gets: As a child that ſeeth the mother have an apple in her hand, and it would faine have it, it will come and pull at the mothers hand for it: now ſhe lets go one finger and yet ſhe holds it, and then he pulls againe, and then ſhe lets goe another finger and yet ſhe keepes it, and then the child pulls againe, and will never leave pulling and crying till it hath got it from his mother: So a child of God ſeeing all graces to be in God, he drawes neere to the throne of grace begging for it, &amp; by his earneſt &amp; faithful praiers, he opens the hands of God to him: God dealing as parents to their children, holds them off for a while, not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:121624:17"/> that he is unwilling to give, but to make them more earneſt with God: to draw them the neerer to himſelfe; a wicked man praies and his praiers tumble downe upon him againe; and his heart is as dead as ever it was before, as ſenſuall as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as carnall and earthly as ever, as hard, as impenitent and ſecure as ever.</p>
                  <p>A godly man when he praies, though he have not gotten the thing totall that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet he is neerer God then he was before; his heart growes every day better then other by his praiers; he obtaines ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as the Prophet <hi>Hoſeah</hi> ſpeakes of knowledge <hi>Hoſ. 6. 3. Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord:</hi> ſo I may ſay of praier, &amp; of al other good duties, then we pray if we proceed on-wards in praier.</p>
                  <p>A man may know and know, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know the Lord, till he goe on in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; ſo a man may pray and pray, yet if he goe not on-wards in his praiers, his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are nothing. A godly man praies as a builder builds; now a builder he firſt layeth a foundation, and becauſe he cannot finiſh in one day, he comes the ſecond day, and findes the frame ſtanding that he made the firſt day, and then he adds a ſecond dayes worke, and then he comes a third day and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:121624:17"/> findes his two former dayes worke ſtanding; then he proceeds to a third dayes worke, and makes walls to it, and ſo he goes on till his building be finiſhed. So prayer it is the building of the ſoule till it reach up to heaven; therefore a godly heart praies and reacheth higher &amp; higher in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, till at laſt his prayers reach up to God.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſigne of a wicked man to pray and to let his prayers fall downe againe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. And here I appeale to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of wicked men, if it be not ſo with them; they pray and pray, but their hearts are as dead and deceitfull, as proud and vaine, as ignorant, blockiſh and rebellious, as if they had never praied.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is more and more a fervent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> praier; if a little praier will not ſerve the turne, if he ſpeeds not to day, then he will pray more earneſtly to morrow; and if that will not ſerve the turne, he will adde more.</p>
                  <p>As a man in winding up of a bucket, if two or three windings will not fetch it up, he will winde it up higher and higher, till it comes up; for if he ſhould onely winde up once or twiſe and no more, but hold it juſt at the ſame pin, the bucket would never come up; So if a man praies and praies, and windes not up his heart higher, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:121624:18"/> holds it juſt at the ſame pegge it was, praies in the ſame faſhion he did, grace will never come up. Marke then how thou prayeſt, examine thy heart; doſt thou pray to day as yeſterday, with no more zeal, nor feeling affection, nor ſencible deſire? thou praieſt not unſatiably.</p>
                  <p>No, thou reſtraineſt thy praying from growing, an excellent diſcription of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, <hi>Iob</hi> 14. 4. though falſly applied to <hi>Job. Thou reſtraineſt prayer before God;</hi> in ſome tranſlations it is <hi>Thou keepeſt thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from growing,</hi> thou reſtraineſt thy praiers as a dwarffe is reſtrained from growing, ſo thou reſtraineſt thy praiers from being more and more earneſt and effectuall and fervent, unſatiable praier is growing in zeale and affection.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly it is a more and more frequent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> praier, ſo that if twice a day will not ſerve the turne, <hi>he will pray three times a day. Pſal.</hi> 55. 17. and if that will not prevaile, <hi>he will pray ſeven times a day. Pſal.</hi> 119. 164. and when that is not enough, he will be even ever a praying, hardly broken off day or night. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 1. he cares not how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten he praies; it may be that thou haſt been a ſuitor for ſtrength and grace againſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and haſt put up many praiers to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:121624:18"/> ſame purpoſe: If now thou ſtickeſt at any praiers, thy praiers are not unſatiable; an unſatiable ſoul never reſteth, though it have made ten thouſand praiers, till it have gotten the grace; it is ſo with other things, and therefore we neede not wonder at it; when a man doth his worke one day, he will do it another, and ſo on as long as he lives till his worke be done; ſo muſt we doe for heaven and for grace.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly it is ever more and more a backt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> praier: if ordinary praiers will not ſerve the turne: a godly heart will cut off time from his recreations and pleaſures, though in themſelves lawfull. Beloved, it may be with thy ſoule in its wra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thou maieſt pray unto God, and God may give thee many temporall bleſſings, and <hi>many common</hi> graces of his Spirit; God may give thee good parts, a good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: he may give thee a good meaſure of knowledge and underſtanding, even in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things; he may give thee ſome kinde of humility, chaſtity, civility: thou maieſt be of a loving and flexible diſpoſition: ſo he may give thee a good eſtate in the world, houſes, lands, wife and children &amp;c. God may give thee <hi>all theſe,</hi> and yet hate thee, and never heare one praier thou makeſt; thou maiſt pray for a thouſand bleſſings, and have them: and yet never be heard, ſo long as the good will of the giver is ſevered from them; all outward bleſſings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon graces may be ſevered from Gods
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121624:27"/> good pleaſure to a man.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in temporall bleſſings, or in common graces, if thou wouldſt know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God heare thee or no: know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath given thee a <hi>ſanctified uſe</hi> of them or no. If God hath given thee many common graces, or temporall bleſſings, and <hi>a heart</hi> to uſe them to his Glory; then every bleſſing thou haſt (there is not a droppe of drinke, nor a bit of bread that thou haſt, but) it is a ſigne of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting love to thee. Why? becauſe this, and the good will of the giver can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſevered. But on the contrary, if a man have not a ſanctified uſe of that he hath, <hi>then</hi> it is the greateſt ſeverity of God, and the moſt eminent plague and curſe of God upon the ſoule <hi>to give it;</hi> for a mans parts may be his b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sixthly <hi>faith;</hi> if a man have faith given <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> him <hi>to beleive,</hi> it is a ſigne that God heares him; <hi>be it to thee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the man in the Goſpell) <hi>according to thy faith;</hi> ſo goe thou to God, and be it to thee as thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveſt.

                     <hi>an adulterous generation ſeeketh a ſigne:</hi> this is <hi>a tempting faith,</hi> to ſeeke for ſignes to believe. <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, Joh. 20. 29. <hi>becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, thou haſt believed: bleſſed are they that have not ſeene and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> That man that believes bacauſe he feels griefe in his heart, teares in his eyes, groans in his ſpirit, becauſe he prayes long and earneſtly, and ſweats in his praier, or mourns in his humiliation, I ſuſpect his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, his teares, his griefe, his praiers, and all that he hath.

                  <p>That every <hi>Promiſe</hi> runnes with a <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>

                     <hi>Promiſe;</hi> the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is the ground of faith, and the way to get the condition; becauſe the promiſe is the <hi>Motive</hi> cauſe that moves the ſoule to get the condition. Now, the <hi>Mover</hi> muſt be before the <hi>Moved;</hi> then if <hi>beliefe</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe</hi> move thy ſoule to get the condition of the promiſe, then beliefe of the promiſe muſt be before that the ſoule can keepe the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> made a promiſe to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 18. that he ſhould be his ſonne in law in one of his two daughters, upon condition that he ſhould give him an hundred fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins of the Philiſtims. Now, <hi>David</hi> did firſt believe the promiſe; and thereby he was allured to fight valiantly, to keepe the condition, to get a hundred fore-skins of the Philiſtims. So Pſal. 116. <hi>I believed and therefore did I ſpeake.</hi> He beleeved Gods promiſe, and then he ſpake with condition. So, <hi>we believe</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe we ſpeake.</hi> Firſt, the ſoule beleeves; and then every action of a Chriſtian wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it moves to the keeping of the condition,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:121624:28"/> ſprings from this root; nay beloved, a man cannot keep any condition in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without faith; <hi>he muſt believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>faith is the inabling cauſe to</hi>

                     <hi>keep the condition.</hi> Doſt thou thinke to get weeping, mourning, and humiliation for thy ſinnes, and then thereby to get the promiſe to thy ſelfe? then thou goeſt in thy owne ſtrength; and then, in Gods account, thou doſt juſt nothing, John 15. 5. <hi>Without me ye can doe nothing,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt <hi>lay hold</hi> on me, <hi>beleeve</hi> in me, <hi>abide</hi> in me.</p>
                  <p>What! doe you firſt think to pray, to mourne, to lament and bewaile your ſinnes, to do this and that in turning your ſelves, and ſanctifying of your ſelves? Indeed you may fumble about theſe things: but you can never do any of them in deed and to the purpoſe: <hi>without me ye can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I had fainted</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I had beleeved to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the land of the living,</hi> Pſal. 27. 13. where we may ſee three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>the Promiſe</hi> that he ſhould ſee the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> goodneſſe of the Lord: otherwiſe he could not have beleeved.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:121624:29"/> Thirdly, <hi>the method the Prophet went by.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, he beleeved to ſee the goodneſſe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Lord. As if he had ſaid, if he had not firſt laid hold on the Promiſe, if I had not beleeved to have ſeen the goodneſſe of the Lord in the Land of the living, I had fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, it is true that the keeping of the Condition, is before the <hi>fruition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:</hi> but not before <hi>beleeving the Promiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> becauſe the <hi>doing of the Condition</hi> is effected by <hi>beleeving the Promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the cauſe that many fumble about grace, but never get it: they are ever repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but never repent: ever learning, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learne the knowledge of the truth ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: ever ſtriving, but never get power over their corruptions, &amp;c. becauſe they fumble about it <hi>in their own ſtrength;</hi> and take it not in the right method.</p>
                  <p>Let the ſoule come with faith in Chriſt, and believe it ſhall ſpeed and have grace, and power from Chriſt his grace, and from Chriſts power: and <hi>then</hi> it ſhall ſpeed; Chriſt hath promiſed (<hi>John</hi> 16.) that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we aske the Father in his name, he will give it us. Chriſt (beloved) is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Surety.</hi> Indeed, our credit is crackt in Heaven: we may thinke to goe and fetch
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:121624:29"/> this and that grace in our owne names, and miſſe of it: as the <hi>ſervant</hi> may goe to the <hi>Merchant</hi> for wares in his owne name, but the Merchant will not deliver them to him in his own name, unleſſe he come in his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> name and bring a ticket from him: and <hi>then</hi> when the ſervant ſheweth his Maſters ticket, the Merchant will deliver him what wares he asketh for in his Maſters name. So when a ſoule goeth to the <hi>Throne of grace</hi> with a ticket from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> if he can ſay Lord, it is for the honour of Chriſt: I come for grace and holineſſe, and ſtrength againſt my corruptions: Lord, here is a tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket from Chriſt: moſt <hi>certainly,</hi> he ſhall ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>But, men muſt take heed that they foyſt not the name of Chriſt: that they foyſt not a ticket to ſay that Chriſt ſent them, when it is their own <hi>ſelfe-love,</hi> and their owne luſt that ſends them; it is not enough to pray and at the end to ſay <hi>through Chriſt our Lord, Amen.</hi> No: for this may be a meere foyſting of the Name of Chriſt. But, canſt thou pray and ſhew that Chriſt ſent thee, and ſay as the ſervant, I come from my Maſter, and he ſent me? Lord, it is for Chriſt that I come: it is not to ſatisfie my owne luſt, nor to eaſe and deliver me from
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:121624:30"/> the galls of my conſcience, nor to free me from hell; but for Chriſt; Lord, I begge grace and holineſſe, that I may have power to glorifie Chriſt. It is for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my Lord Chriſt that I come. When the ſoul comes thus in Chriſts name, beleeving it ſhall ſpeed, then his prayer ſhall prevaile. <hi>Whatſoever</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ye ſhall aske the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We come now to the third and laſt part of our Text: to wit, the ſupplies they had againſt danger and diſcouragements. The Lord upheld their hearts from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed in prayer; <hi>thou ſaidſt feare not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be two things that do much hurt in prayer.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>needleſſe diſcouragements.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſay, <hi>groundleſſe incouragements;</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and theſe the wicked are moſt ſubject to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, who becauſe they <hi>pray, heare the Word,</hi> and performe many duties of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore they incourage themſelves in the goodneſſe of their eſtates, judgeing themſelves happy, though notwithſtanding they go on and continue in the hardneſſe of their hearts and rebellions againſt God.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:121624:30"/>
                  <p>We have abundance of <hi>ſayings</hi> amongſt us, that if they were examined would prove falſe and unſound; As, <hi>that</hi> the vipers die when they bring forth their young; for (ſay they) the young eate out the old ones bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; <hi>that</hi> beares ſhape all their <hi>young</hi> by licking of them; that the Swanne ſingeth ſweeteſt at her death; that the Adamant ſtone is ſoftned by Goats blood, &amp;c. Theſe things are not ſo, as may be ſhewn out of ancient Writers.</p>
                  <p>So, beloved, there are abundance of <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> that goe up and down amongſt men concerning <hi>Divinity,</hi> which if they were examined, will prove to be rotten ſayings; as, he that made them, will ſave them. It is not ſo, ſaith the Prophet, Eſal. 27. 11. <hi>He that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will not pitty them.</hi> It is commonly beleeved, if men come to Church, heare the <hi>Word,</hi> and call upon God, that then preſently they are good Chriſtians. Beloved, it is not ſo, Matth. 7. 21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men are ready when they can but call <hi>Lord have mercy on me; O ſweet Saviour, pitty me, moſt mercifull Lord Jeſus, have compaſsion on me:</hi> if they can <hi>pray in their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:121624:31"/> families,</hi> and pray at Church, &amp;c. to think, now, all is well with them, and Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſave them, and give them the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven: but our Saviour puts a <hi>not</hi> upon it, and ſaith, <hi>not every one</hi> that ſaith Lord, Lord: it is not a <hi>Lord,</hi> a Lording of Chriſt with the tongne onely: it is not a taking up of an outward profeſſion of Chriſt only, that is ſufficient for a man that ſhall inherit the Kingdome of Heaven: no ſaith Chriſt: but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven. But, of this by the <hi>by.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are <hi>needleſſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which doe much hurt in prayer. Needleſſe diſcouragements doe much hurt to many a poore ſoule, that hath forcible <hi>wouldings,</hi> and wracked deſires after grace and holineſſe, and yet is held by diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements: yea, many a Chriſtian heart lieth a long time under it wraſtling and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under its wants, and yet, kept out from grace, and from growing in grace, becauſe of diſcouragements: yea the beſt and ſtrongeſt of Gods Saints, have been kept off, and have hung much on diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feare not,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Geneſ. 15. 1. So, feare not <hi>Joſhua,</hi> ſaith God to

                  <p>It is a <hi>baſe diſmayment</hi> of ſpirit below or beneath the ſtrength that is in a man, vnder the apprehenſion of ſome evill, as if it were too hard for him to grapple with it.</p>
                  <p>There be foure things in this diffinition.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſay it is a <hi>baſe diſmayment</hi> of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and ſo I call it to diſtinguiſh it: for there is an humble diſmayment which a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is commanded. A man is bound to be diſmayed for his ſinnes. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 32. 11. <hi>Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ye careleſſe women that are at eaſe, be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ye careleſſe ones:</hi> theſe careleſſe ones
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:121624:32"/> went on in their ſinnes, and feared not. God calls to them and bids them to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed. But the diſmayment and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement I ſpeake of, it is a baſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayment of ſpirit; which is either when <hi>he</hi> is diſmayed <hi>that ought not:</hi> or he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed <hi>at that whereat he ought not to feare:</hi> where no cauſe of feare is.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Vitello</hi> his man thought his Maſter had got skill in Optickes: he riding along upon the high way, ſpying a mans ſhape, thought it was ſome Spirit: and thereupon he ſickened and died. So many a poor ſoul looking in the perfect Law of God, and ſeeing his owne uglineſſe and filthyneſſe, he is diſcouraged, and thinkes himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; his heart waxeth cold within him, and he begins to feare that he is but a dead and damned man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>it is downe beneath the ſtrength</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>that is in a man:</hi> that man is properly ſaid to be diſcouraged: not that he hath no ſtrength at all in him, nor no courage at all (for ſuch a one is an <hi>infeebled</hi> man, not a man diſcouraged) but a diſcouraged man is a man put beſides the courage that is in him; when a man hath ſtrength enough to grapple with the evill before him, but through diſmayment of ſpirit he cannot put it forth.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:121624:32"/>
                  <p>Have not I commanded thee? ſaith God to <hi>Joſhua; Be ſtrong and of a good courage,</hi> be not afraid, neither be thou diſmaied, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. God had given <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſtrength enough, whereby he was inabled to obſerve and do according to all that Law which <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of the Lord commanded him; God had now doubled his Spirit upon him: yet he commands him, <hi>be not afraid, neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed:</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> if thou beeſt diſmayed and diſcouraged, though thou haſt ſtrength and power to go through the buſineſſe that I have called thee unto, yet thou wilt not be able to uſe it, nor to put it forth if thou beeſt diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>it is at the apprehenſion of ſome</hi>

                     <hi>evill.</hi> I ſay not at the ſight of ſome evill: for a man may be diſmayed at the appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good, as <hi>Mary</hi> when ſhe ſaw nothing but a good Angell, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 29. ſhe ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a glorious Angel: nevertheleſſe ſhe was afraid, and diſcouraged. Why? becauſe ſhe had a ſecret apprehenſion of ſome evill, either of ſome evill proceeded in the ſalutation, or ſome unworthineſſe in her ſelfe to receive ſuch a gracious ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: it cannot be the apprehenſion of any good that diſcourageth a man, but the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſome evill.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:121624:33"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>not of every evill</hi> neither; for if the evill be but ſmall, courage will ſtand it out; but <hi>it is of ſuch an evill as he feares he is not able to grapple withall.</hi> If the evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, be inferiour to him, he ſcornes it as the barking of a toothleſſe Dog. If it be but an evill equall to his ſtrength, then he makes a tuſh at it, becauſe he knowes or thinkes himſelfe able to encounter with it.</p>
                  <p>But if it be an evill above his ſtrength, then his ſpirit melts and droops before him. See this in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 11. and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When they ſaw the Champion of the Philiſtims comming againſt them, when they ſaw him ſo hugely and mervelouſly armed, and heard him ſpeake ſuch bigge words, they thought they were not able to ſtand and to encounter with him; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Text, when <hi>Saul</hi> and all <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> heard theſe words of the Philiſtim, they were diſmayed and greatly afraid.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee what diſcouragement is; ſuch diſcouragements the Lord would not have our hearts to be in when we pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, <hi>God cannot give care to that man</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>that is out of heart in his prayers.</hi> Thou canſt never pray if thou beeſt diſmaied in prayer. When the ſoul begins to feare and reaſon,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:121624:33"/> 
                     <hi>O, I am ſo unworthy that God will not looke at me; I am ſo ſinfull, ſo blockiſh, ſo dead, and dull to all good, that God will never regard me;</hi> thou canſt never pray, Rom. 10. 14. <hi>How ſhall they call on him in whom they have not beleeved?</hi> If thou doſt not believe that God will heare thee, if thou doſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that thou ſhalt prevaile, that God will deliver thee out of theſe corruptions and that luſt that thou praieſt againſt; that God will give thee this grace or that grace: if thou doſt not beleeve that God will owne thee: if thou haſt theſe doubtfull diſcouragements, <hi>O, he will not grant me, I ſhall never get this or that:</hi> how canſt thou call on him? thou mayeſt call ſo and ſo: but never canſt thou call to any purpoſe, if thou doſt not beleeve in him.</p>
                  <p>A begger though he be never ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to begge, yet if when he comes to the Houſe-keepers dore, he be perſwaded that he ſhall not ſpeed, that let him beg as long as he will, he ſhall get nothing: this blunts his begging, and makes him give over his ſuite without any great importunity: So, it is impoſſible that ever a ſoule ſhould hold out and pray that is diſcouraged in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>thou canſt not pray unleſſe thou
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:121624:34"/> uſe all thy ſtrength in prayer;</hi> If thou be diſcouraged, thou canſt not uſe thy ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>A diſcouraged man, his ſtrength melts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to feare; and whatſoever ſtrength he hath, he cannot put it forth. How came <hi>Jacob</hi> to prevaile and to have power with God? Why, he uſed all his ſtrength with God, and ſo prevailed, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 3. Thou canſt never prevaile with God by thy prayers, unleſſe thou putteſt forth all thy ſtrength in praier.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Jacob</hi> had reaſoned <hi>I am but duſt and aſhes; how can I ſtrive with God? I am ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and evill, how can I contend with my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker?</hi> and ſo have beene diſcouraged in his wraſtling, he could not have uſed all his ſtrength with God, and ſo had never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with God. No, <hi>Jacob</hi> he gathers all the arguments that he could make; he gathers together all the promiſes he could finde in Gods Book, or that he could heare off; he diſplaies all the wants that he could ſhew; he petitions all the graces that he could name; he uſed all his ſtrength, and by his ſtrength he had power with God.</p>
                  <p>If thy confeſſion of thy ſins be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; if thy petitions, and thankeſgiving for grace, be ſtrengthleſſe; if thou uſe not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:121624:34"/> all thy ſtrength in prayer, thou canſt never prevaile, nor have any power with God. For how can that man prevaile and have power with God that hath no power with himſelfe?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>thou canſt never pray, and have a</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>fearefull apprehenſion of evill in prayer;</hi> thou canſt not. It is good to have a deepe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of thy ſinnes: apprehend them to be as many hells as thou canſt, thou canſt never apprehend them deeply enough: but if thou haſt a fearefull apprehenſion of them, thou canſt never pray.</p>
                  <p>When the Apoſtle would exhort the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipians</hi> to continue in one Spirit, and in one minde, fighting together through the faith of the Goſpell, he exhorts them <hi>that in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they feare,</hi> Phil. 1. 27, 28. For if a man be terrified with his adverſary, with the power of his adverſary, and feares he ſhall never be able to withſtand him but muſt fall before him through his ſubtilty, that he can never be wary enough for him: Alas, he can never ſtrive with hope and courage againſt him. So, beloved, if we have a fearefull and diſcouraged kinde of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of evill, we can never pray ſo as to prevaile.</p>
                  <p>Apprehend thy ſinnes to be as helliſh,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:121624:35"/> and as damnable as thou canſt: Feele even the fire of hell in every one of them: but take heed of a <hi>fearefull</hi> apprehenſion of them, <hi>ſo</hi> to apprehend the evill of them, as to thinke with thy ſelfe that becauſe thou art guilty of <hi>theſe and theſe</hi> ſinnes, that thou ſhalt never get in with God again, God will never be reconciled to thee: <hi>theſe</hi> will eate out thine heart in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>we can never pray if we have any</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <hi>ſecret diſpaire</hi> that there is any difficulty too hard for us to grapple withall, or to get through in our prayers. Howſoever a man prayes, yet if he have <hi>any ſpice</hi> of theſe feares in him, to thinke <hi>now I have taken a great deale of paines, but am never the better; I have prayed and prayed, but have got no good: I may goe on and doe thus and thus, but ſhall never prevaile or ſpeed; all my labours, all my prayers and indeavours will be loſt;</hi> this takes away the very ſpirit and life of a mans prayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judas</hi> after he had betrayed the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, he was diſcouraged from ever praying for mercy. Why? becauſe he thought it was <hi>impoſsible</hi> for him to get it; <hi>I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed innocent blood,</hi> ſaith he. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>I ſhall never out-wraſtle this ſinne; this ſinne is my death: I have brought
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:121624:35"/> the blood of the Sonne of God on me, I ſhall never claw off this ſinne:</hi> now <hi>Judas</hi> thus deſpayring, we never read one letter of any prayer that he made to God to get out of it; no, he thought it too hard for him to get mercy. Deſpaire drives a man from that he did hope for; becauſe now he thinkes there is an impoſſibility in getting of it.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, miſtake me not; there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſperation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a deſperation of <hi>infidelity;</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and that deads and drawes the ſoule from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a deſperation of <hi>extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And, if ever you meane to come to God, and to get any grace from God, you <hi>muſt</hi> come with deſperation of extremity. deſperation puts <hi>life</hi> into a mans prayers and indeavours.</p>
                  <p>As, a Souldier when he ſeeth nothing but to <hi>kill or be killed,</hi> that he ſees his ſtate deſperate; why, this will compell a very coward to fight; this will make a coward fight (<hi>as if he would kill the Devill,</hi> ſaith the Proverb) it will make him fight like a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; he will be afraid of nothing. Take a Souldier that fights deſperately for his life, with a <hi>kill or be killed;</hi> he feares nothing; neither Pike, nor Sword, nor Gun; why?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:121624:36"/> he fights for his life. Therefore one notes that ſometimes it is the neareſt way to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to be deſperate in attempts and in fight. Therefore when <hi>William the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> came firſt into <hi>England,,</hi> at <hi>Haſting,</hi> he ſent back his Ships againe, that ſo the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers might have no hope of ſaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flying back. And ſo at <hi>Battle,</hi> at <hi>one</hi> encounter, a <hi>little</hi> Army of the Engliſh ſlew a <hi>great</hi> Army of the French. Why? they grew deſperate.</p>
                  <p>So, could men pray deſperately, could they pray with a <hi>pray or be damned:</hi> beg with a <hi>begge or be damned;</hi> ſeeke to God for grace that you want with a <hi>ſpeed or be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;</hi> then would their prayers be more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and powerfull to get grace. O, did men pray thus, they would pray otherwiſe then they doe.</p>
                  <p>Men pray, but they pray deadly, coldly, and lazily, as if they had no need of prayer, or as if they had no need of the grace, they pray for; they pray for grace, but get it not; they pray for zeale, but have it not; for repentance and holineſſe, but obtaine it not.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, either get zeale and holineſſe, or elſe there is no mercy: either get grace and repentance, or elſe there is no mercy
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:121624:36"/> for thee. Pray then when thou prayeſt for grace, with <hi>a ſpeede or be damned;</hi> ſay unto thy ſoule, <hi>either we muſt ſpeede and get grace</hi> Soule, <hi>or elſe we muſt goe to hell.</hi> If men would pray thus, with <hi>a ſpeede or be damned,</hi> we ſhould never ſee, nor God ſhould never heare ſo many cold and dead praiers as now we pray.</p>
                  <p>Deſpaire makes a man a Munke ſaith the Papiſt: but <hi>this deſpayre</hi> makes a man a good Chriſtian I ſay: never doth a man pray indeede till he feels himſelfe in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, hopeles and deſperate in regard of himſelfe; ſo that he ſeeth no remedie at all but <hi>get Chriſt: get grace or be damned for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Get power and ſtrength over theſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> otherwiſe they <hi>will deſtroy and damne thee;</hi> this would make a man pray for life. Men pray coldly and faintly: why? becauſe though they ſee they have no grace, no zeale, no holines, no repentance, no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Chriſt: yet they hope to be ſaved notwithſtanding. O beloved, the divell hath blinded theſe men to the intent they may be damned.</p>
                  <p>But, if men would pray deſperate praiers with a <hi>pray or be damned, ſeeke with a finde or be damned:</hi> men would then pray other praiers then they doe. Such praiers did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:121624:37"/> pray <hi>Pſal. 130. 1. Out of the deepe places have I called unto thee O Lord, Lord heare my prayer:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, I am even in the depth of miſerie, plunged over head and eares, ſo that now I ſinke and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh if thou helpe not: Lord, hear my prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>This deſperation</hi> a Chriſtian muſt have, this quickens up his Spirits, and puts life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: but, take heede of the <hi>deſperation of Infidelity:</hi> Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith it is the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of the ſoule: the ſpice of it will eate out the heart of a man, and kill the ſtrength of all his endeavours.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould now come to apply this doctrine; but I feare me there be many amongſt us, that never come ſo farre towards heaven, as to know what theſe diſcouragements meane. This is lamentable.</p>
                  <p>It is true, <hi>diſcouragements</hi> are hideous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in praier, and a man may periſh and goe to hell that hath them: but yet, they are <hi>ſome-what profitable ſignes</hi> that a man doth at the leaſt looke a little towards God, or elſe he could not know what they are. But there are abundance that never have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo farre in religion, as to underſtand what they meane: but goe on in drinking, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, carding and dicing, hating and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, fretting and chaſing, mocking &amp; cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:121624:37"/> ſwearing and blaſpheming, in ſecurity, in hardnes of heart and impenitencie: they are more carefull for their doggs, for their potts, and for their tables, and for their ſhops, then they are of their ſoules: And which is enough to aſtoniſh any that is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, theſe men ſcarce finde any diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in praier: O, they have a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to pray at all times: O, ſay they, God forbid that any man ſhould be diſcouraged in praier. I thanke God I have a good hope in God; God hath given me a good heart of grace to call upon him, and I make no queſtion but that God heares me: God would never bid us to pray if he did not meane to heare us.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, theſe men that are ſo bold in the goodnes of their hearts to call upon God, they never as yet praied in all their lives: all the praiers of the wicked are indeede no praiers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſſing the ſinnes of wicked <hi>Judah,</hi> ſaith, <hi>though all this evill be come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, yet made we not our prayer to turne from our wicked wayes. Dan.</hi> 9. 13. all the time of thoſe ſeventy yeares, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made praier to God; yet they faſted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very yeare, and praied every day, twiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day at the leaſt, which would amount
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:121624:38"/> in that time to 50000 and 100 prayers: how then could <hi>Daniel</hi> ſay they never made <hi>one</hi> praier? I anſwer, (and pray marke it) <hi>becauſe</hi> they never did quite turne from their evill waies. Though thou makeſt never ſo many praiers, though thou boaſteſt of the goodneſſe of thy condition, and ſnatcheſt at the Promiſes of God: yet if thou turneſt not from thine iniquities, thou never as yet mad'ſt any praier by the Judgement of God himſelfe. <hi>Paul</hi> made many thouſand praiers before his converſion, he could not have beene a Phariſe elſe; but they were never accounted praiers to him: therefore as ſoon as ever he was converted, behold ſaith God <hi>he prayeth Acts</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>A wicked man, a carnall Chriſtian, though he have the righteouſneſſe of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, of living blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, unreproveable in reſpect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward righteouſneſſe of the Law: yet he can never make an <hi>acceptable prayer</hi> till he be truely converted; his praiers are no better then howling of dogs, or lowing of Oxen, yea the Lord abhorrs them. O what <hi>poore</hi> incouragements canſt thou have, ſeeing the Lord never tallies downe any of thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? wicked men are like <hi>ulyſſes,</hi> who wept more for the death of his dogge, then of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:121624:38"/> his wife; ſo wicked men weepe and mourne for the loſſe of their corne and their cattle, hawkes and houndes, cardes and dice: but never for the loſſe of their praiers. So long as thou continueſt in thy prophaneſſe and impenitency, thou loſeſt all thy praiers: there is not one of them that God tallies downe, or reckons for a praier. Here we might have a great deale of matter, if time would ſuffer me. But it will not, onely let me tell you, I ſpeake onely to thoſe whoſe hearts God hath awakened out of their ſinnes, but who are oft diſcouraged: take heede of theſe diſcouragements.</p>
                  <p>For, firſt, <hi>they will drive thee to melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>. Beloved, there are a great many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy men in the world, and this is the cauſe of it; men are contented to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by halves: becauſe they are diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the worke. If thou ſuffer thy ſelfe to be diſcouraged, it will eate up thy ſpirit and thou wilt be like a <hi>ſilly dove without a heart, Prov.</hi> 7. 11. A dove is a melancholy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that hath no heart to any thing; ſo <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> hath no heart to call upon God, no heart to returne unto God: and this is the cauſe that men and women goe whine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning under the burden of ſin, and are not able to come out, becauſe of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:121624:39"/> diſcouragements: all the policie of hell is leſſe then this policy of the divell, in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men to deſpair or diſcouragements: <hi>this</hi> doth more hurt then al the reſt of hel beſides</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if you doe not take heede of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them, they will bring you to ſpeake againſt God, <hi>I have prayed, but the Lord will not heare me: I have called, and the Lord will not anſwer, but hath turned away his eares from me.</hi> Now, thou ſpeakeſt againſt God. <hi>Num.</hi> 21. 4, 5. The ſoule of the people was much diſcouraged, and the people ſpake againſt God, and againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have you brought us out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to die in the wilderneſſe? for here is neither bread, nor water, and our ſoule loatheth this light bread. So, beloved, <hi>if we ſuffer our ſoules to be diſcouraged, we ſhall ſoone come to murmure againſt God:</hi> wherefore hath he brought me up to this ſtrictnes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſſe? when I was a drunkard, a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when I followed the luſt of my fleſh and liberty, then I enjoyed onnions, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, and the fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt:</hi> pleaſures and delights for my ſoule: then I had a good hope in God, and a good perſwaſion that my ſoul ſhould goe to heaven: and then Preachers told me that if I would give over ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, and looke after
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:121624:39"/> Heaven a little more, and doe ſuch and ſuch things, O <hi>then</hi> I ſhould come to a Land flowing with milke and honey, then I ſhould not miſſe of glory and ſalvation; But alas, I ſee nothing but Gyants and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nakims; I am in a wilderneſſe; now, <hi>now</hi> I ſee a man may have a great deal of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and yet be a caſt-away; A man may have a great deal of faith &amp; yet be but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate; A man may give over a great <hi>many</hi> ſins, and yet periſh in hell; now I ſee a man may live civilly and well, and have &amp; do a great many good things, and yet be damned when he hath done all: A man may even goe to Heaven Gates, and yet the gates be ſhut againſt him, and he turned into hell. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! my poore ſoule is in a wilderneſſe; <hi>now</hi> I know not which way to goe; I am ready to loſe my ſelfe, I ſee nothing here <hi>now</hi> but huge Gyants, the ſonnes of <hi>Anack, ſtrong corruptions,</hi> inclining and forcing me to evill: moſt fearefull and violent ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and temptations of the Devill, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to thruſt me into the gulfe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>And now, the ſoule begins to thinke that it is good for it to returne again into Egypt, to fall to its old courſes againe: for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God lookes for no ſuch matter, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:121624:40"/> no ſuch ſtrictneſſe and preciſeneſſe: And ſo it falls a whining and repining at the Word and Miniſters of God that have call'd men to it, and laid it upon them: and hath no heart now to do thus and thus any longer. And <hi>thus</hi> it falls into diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments becauſe of the way, and into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>quandaries</hi> whether it may not goe back againe or no. And all theſe murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and repinings, are becauſe men ſuffer themſelves to be diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>diſcouragements will cauſe thee to thinke that God hates thee.</hi> When the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſoule like <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, hath been crying from morning to noone; ten, twenty, thirty yeeres, it may be, and yet hath no anſwer: <hi>now,</hi> it will begin to thinke <hi>if God did love me, then he would grant me my petitions.</hi> Then hereupon comes into a mans ſecret thoughts and feares <hi>that God hardly loves his ſoule.</hi> So was it with <hi>Iſrael;</hi> when they were diſcouraged, they ſaid, <hi>becauſe the Lord hated us, therefore he brought us out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> Deut. 1. 27. Becauſe that they were diſcouraged, and becauſe that their Brethren that went for ſpies, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned them; therefore they were apt to ſay the Lord hated them.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, it is a miſerable thing when

                     </gap>lancholy thoughts and feares, and diſcouragements, drive the ſoule to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire. For when the ſoule ſees it ſelfe ſtill diſappointed of its hopes, at the laſt it grows hopeleſſe: If it have waited one day and the next day too: if it have praied this weeke, this month, this yeare, and yet ſtill it ſeeth it ſelfe held off and diſappointed: it will at laſt grow hopeleſſe. Take heed therefore, I beſeech you, of all needleſſe diſcouragements; to fear be auſe that thou findeſt not that that thou wiſhedſt or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt for, to day or to morrow, in thine own time, that therefore thou ſhalt <hi>never</hi> get it, that now thou ſhouldeſt for ever deſpaire of the grace and love of God, and thinke that now God will never heare thee, that thou ſhalt never get grace and power over thy corruptions.</p>
                  <p>Men thinke that the preaching of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121624:41"/> Word of God brings men to deſpaire, the preaching of ſuch <hi>ſtrict</hi> points, and the urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch <hi>preciſe</hi> doctrines makes men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire: men are loth to be at the paines to root out their diſcouragements: It is rather a cold or dead preaching of the Word that is the cauſe of this: for when the ſoule is <hi>inſtructed by holineſſe,</hi> humbled by holineſſe, converted by holineſſe, at the laſt when it comes to be thorowly awakened, when it ſees that <hi>this</hi> and <hi>this</hi> is required in a true converſion of the ſoule to God, that <hi>herein</hi> true repentance muſt declare and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it ſelfe by <hi>theſe</hi> and <hi>theſe</hi> fruits, or elſe it is but falſe and rotten: Why now, the ſoul muſt needs be brought to deſpaire, becauſe it ſeeth that though it have been thus and thus humbled, though it have praied, faſted and mourned in this and this manner: yet it ſees it hath not a <hi>ſoundneſſe</hi> of grace.</p>
                  <p>There is ſuch a grace in it, ſuch a worke and ſuch a fruit of Gods Spirit in it, that yet he could never finde in himſelfe: this makes the ſoule to deſpaire. Indeed Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may be too blame if they ſpeake and preach <hi>onely</hi> the terrours and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Law without the promiſes of the Goſpel: for <hi>theſe</hi> ſhould be ſo tempered
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:121624:41"/> that every poore broken ſoule may ſee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and redemption for him upon his ſound and unfeined repentance and humiliation. But if men doe deſpaire, they may thanke themſelves for it, their owne ſinnes for it, their owne diſcouragements for it, becauſe they ſuffer theſe to continue in them.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:121624:42"/> it is no wonder if the ſoule fall into deſperation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cain</hi> let his ſinne lie at the dore, there it lay rapping and beating, and told him that his careleſeneſſe and negligent ſacrificing to God was not accepted: and therefore no marvell if <hi>Cain</hi> be ſo caſt down in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and that he fall to deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>O beloved, when ſinne lieth bouncing and beating at the dore of thy heart, when thy ſinne (whatſoever it is, ſearch thy heart and finde it out) lies knocking and rapping at the dore of thy conſcience <hi>day by day,</hi> and month by month, and thou art content to let it lie, and art unwilling to uſe meanes to remove it, and art loth to take the paines to get the bloud of Chriſt to waſh thy ſoule from it, or the Spirit of Chriſt to cleanſe thee from it; then thy ſoule will deſpaire, either in this world, or in the world to come. But let us take heede then, that our conſcience condemne us not in any thing or courſe that we allow in our ſelves: for if <hi>that doe,</hi> then much more will God who is greater then our conſciences, and knowes all things.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle hath an excellent Phraſe: <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:121624:42"/> ſay, there is not <hi>one</hi> condemnation; there is none in <hi>Heaven,</hi> God doth not condemne them; there is none in <hi>earth,</hi> their owne heart and conſcience doth not condemne them; he that is in Chriſt Jeſus, that walks not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, there is none, no <hi>not one</hi> condemnation to him; <hi>none,</hi> neither in Heaven nor in earth: no word, no commandement, no threatning condemnes him. But if thy conſcience condemne thee, and tell thee thou letteſt ſin lie at the dore, rapping at thy conſcience day after day, and month after month, telling thee that yet thou art <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> that yet thou never hadſt any true faith in the Lord Jeſus, that yet thou haſt not <hi>truely</hi> repented, and turned from thy ſinnes: this will at laſt drive thy ſoule into <hi>heavie</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, if not into <hi>finall</hi> deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>O beloved, religion and piety, and the power of godlineſſe, goe downe the winde every where. What is the reaſon of it, but becauſe of theſe diſcouragements that men live and go in? Men pray and pray, and their prayers profit them not: men run up and downe and come to the Church and heare the Word, and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and uſe the meanes of grace, but to no <hi>end: they</hi> are unprofitable to them: they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:121624:43"/> remaine in their ſinnes ſtill: the ordinances of God bring them not out of their luſts and corruptions: hereby they diſgrace and diſcredit the ordinances of God in the eyes and account of the men of the world, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them thinke as if there were no more power nor force in the Ordinances of God then theſe men manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>There is no life in many Chriſtians, mens ſpirits are diſcouraged; theſe ſecret diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements in their hearts take away their ſpirits in the uſe of the meanes, that though they uſe the meanes, yet it drives them to deſpaire of reaping good or profit by them.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, I could here tell you enough to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> make your hearts ake to heare it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>all your complaints they are hut winde,</hi> Job 6. 26. doe you imagine to reprove words, and the ſpeeches of one that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate which are as winde? <hi>Jobs</hi> friends taking <hi>Job</hi> to be a man of deſpaire, they accounted all his words but as winde.</p>
                  <p>Doeſt thou neſtle any diſcouragement in thy heart? thou maiſt complaine of ſinne as much as thou canſt: yet all thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings are but as winde: thou maiſt cry out againſt thy corruptions, with weeping and teares, and pray and fight againſt them:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:121624:43"/> and yet all thy weeping, mourning and praying is but as the winde: thou maieſt beg grace, thou maiſt ſeeke after God, thou maiſt heare the Word, receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet all will be to thee as wind: all will vaniſh, be unprofitable, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>diſcouragements drive us from</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>the uſe of the meanes.</hi> If ever we meane to come out of our ſinnes, if ever we meane to get grace and faith, and aſſurance, and zeale: we <hi>muſt conſtantly</hi> uſe the meanes, 1 Sam. 27. 1. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, there is nothing better for me then that I ſhould ſpeedily eſcape into the Land of the Philiſtims, and <hi>Saul</hi> ſhall deſpaire of me to ſeeke me any more. <hi>David</hi> thought in himſelfe, if I can make him out of hope of finding me, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely he will give over ſeeking of me. So when the ſoule hath any ſecret deſpaire of finding the Lord, that ſoule will quickly be drawne from ſeeking of the Lord in the uſe of the meanes.</p>
                  <p>What ever you doe then, O be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, leſt you be driven from the uſe of the meanes: if you be driven from the uſe of the <hi>meanes,</hi> woe is to you, you will never finde God then. Be not driven from praier, nor driven from holy conference,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:121624:44"/> nor driven from the Word, nor driven from the Sacrament, nor from meditation, nor from the diligent and ſtrict examination of thy ſelfe, of thy heart and of all thy waies: for theſe are the waies of finding the Lord. If you nouriſh any thoughts and feares of deſpaire in you, if you be diſcouraged, you will be driven from the uſe of the meanes, which is a lamentable thing; therefore be not diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, diſcouragements will make you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſtand poaring on your former courſes, <hi>thus I ſhould have done, and that I ſhould have done, woe is me that I did it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> it will make a man ſtand poaring on his ſinnes, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to get out of them. So it was like to be with them in the Ship with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 27. 20. In the tempeſt at Sea, they were utterly diſcouraged from any hope of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: now indeed <hi>Paul</hi> told them what they ſhould have done if they had been wiſe: Sirs, <hi>you ſhould have hearkned to me, and not have looſed,</hi> ver. 21. as if he had ſaid, you ſhould have done thus and thus: but <hi>now</hi> doe not ſtand poaring too much on that, you ſhould have hearkned to me, and not have launched forth, &amp;c. but that cannot be holpen, <hi>now:</hi> therefore I exhort you to be of good cheare, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:121624:44"/>
                  <p>So beloved, when the ſoule is diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon theſe thoughts, <hi>I ſhould have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better, I ſhould have heard the Word of God better, and with more profit; I ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented better, I ſhould have performed this and that religious and good dutie better; but ah wretch that I am, I have ſinned thus and thus;</hi> it is alwaies looking on this ſinne and that ſinne, this imperfection and that failing: when now I ſay the ſoule is diſcouraged, it will be alwaies poaring upon ſinne, but it will never come out of its ſinne; alwaies poaring upon its deadneſſe, and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, but never able to come out of it. O beloved, be of good cheare, and be not diſcouraged; it is true you ſhould have prayed better; you ſhould have heard the Word of God better heretofore, you ſhould have been more carefull and circumſpect of your wayes then you were; but now you cannot helpe it; theſe things and times are gone and cannot be recalled: ſuch a one hath been a drunkard, a ſwearer, a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp;c. but he cannot helpe it now. True, he might have helped it, and becauſe he did not, his heart ſhall bleed for it, if he belong to God: but doe not ſtand poaring too much upon it, but conſider <hi>now</hi> what you have to doe, <hi>now</hi> you are to humble your
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:121624:45"/> ſelfe, now you are to ſtrive with God in all manner of prayer for more grace, and more power of obedience and aſſurance, and be not diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>if the ſoule be diſcouraged, it</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <hi>will breed nothing but ſorrow.</hi> What is the reaſon that many Chriſtians are alwaies weeping, and mourning, and ſighing, and ſobbing, from day to day, all their life time, and will not be comforted? becauſe of theſe diſcouragements, 1 Theſ. 4. 13. <hi>Sorrow not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as thoſe that have no hope,</hi> as if he had ſaid, ſorrow if you will; but do not ſorrow as they that have no hope.</p>
                  <p>How is that? it is a ſorrow with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſorrow, from which they have no hope of inlargement or freedome.</p>
                  <p>O then my brethren, ſuppoſe you have dead hearts, ſuppoſe you want zeale, you want aſſurance; ſuppoſe it be ſo, yet labour to attaine theſe graces; ſorrow and ſpare not; weepe and mourne, and powre out whole buckets of teares for your ſinnes, if you can: but, <hi>ſorrow not with nothing but ſorrow:</hi> be not diſcouraged: ſuppoſe that thou haſt a dead heart, that thou art an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, that thou haſt a rotten heart; it is a heavie thing, and a fearefull caſe indeed,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:121624:45"/> for which thou haſt great cauſe of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſorrow; but yet <hi>ſorrow not deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately</hi> as men without hope: be not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcouraged, but as you ſorrow for your ſins, ſo alſo labour with incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to get out and be rid of your ſins. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>diſcouragements breed and procure a totall perplexity.</hi> They leave the ſoule in a maze, that it knowes not whether to turne it ſelfe. When men come to be diſcouraged, <hi>Oh what ſhall I doe</hi> ſaith one, <hi>I am utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done</hi> ſaith another: <hi>I know not what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me,</hi> ſaith a third: <hi>Oh I am utterly loſt, I ſhall periſh one day, one day God will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me, and be avenged on me for this and that ſin: I were as good go to hell at the firſt as at the laſt, for that will be the end of me: I have gon to Prayer, but that doth not helpe me: I have gone to Sacraments, but I finde no helpe: ſtill my ſoule lies under the power of ſinne; ſtill my ſinnes are as ſtrong in me as ever:</hi> Thus the ſoule is diſcouraged and cryes out, <hi>Oh, what ſhall I doe? I know not what to doe. What ſhall I doe</hi> ſayeſt thou?</p>
                  <p>Alas, thou haſt things enough to doe, if thou wert not diſcouraged. <hi>Utterly undone</hi>

                     </gap>e? yea, poore ſoule, there is mercy, grace and peace <hi>for thee,</hi> if thou wilt not be diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>diſcouragements whiſper within a</hi>

                  <p>If you deſpaire in the Lord, you have the ſentence of death and damnation from God in your conſcience; take heed of this my beloved; be not diſcouraged in God: do not deſpaire in the Lord: <hi>that</hi> will worke a <hi>miſerable</hi> effect in your ſoules: it will ſecretly whiſper a ſentence of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your ſoules.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtrange to conſider how many poore ſoules rub on with theſe whiſpering ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their boſomes, ſuffering their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences day by day to tell them that they are rotten, to tell them that they were never yet converted, to tell them that they are yet in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:121624:46"/> the ſtate of damnation, and yet they will not root out theſe diſcouragements.</p>
                  <p>O goe to the <hi>Throne of grace,</hi> beg for grace and for mercy, and for power againſt ſinne, and be not diſcouraged. What? wilt thou carry thy owne ſentence of death in thy breſt? if thou wilt not rouze up thy ſoule, and pray with more affection and confidence, and ſhake off diſcouragements, take heed leſt thou carry the ſentence of thy own death and damnation in thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. O therefore <hi>once more</hi> let me beſeech you to take heed of theſe diſcouragements, and now hearken to the voice of God which calleth upon you, <hi>feare not.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>this is ſpoken hyperbolically,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the great miſerie the creatures are in to ſerve ſinfull man: the creatures were made to ſerve with reference to a holy God. Oh what miſerie then is it for them to be ſerviceable to ſinefull and ungodly men? thus, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> doth the Prophet bring in the vines groaning, the roofe of the temple and the very high-waies groaning upon mens ſinnes, to ſignify the exceeding great deſire that each of the creatures have to be redeemed from ſuch a thraldome.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is ſpoken <hi>Analogically,</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> regard of a naturall inſtinct of blinde rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is in all the creatures: for they have all reaſon, as if it were reaſon indeed: they have all a ſhadow of reaſon: the graſſe growes as right, as if it knew how to grow: the wheate ſproutes forth, as if it knew how to ſproute forth; every creature acteth by a rule, which it ſwerveth not from, as if it were endued with reaſon to act by. A ſtone falling findes out the ſtraight line of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, as if it had reaſon to pecke it out. Let a ſtone be caſt up in the aire, all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:121624:50"/> under heaven cannot finde a ſtraighter line then it will to fall downe by; ſo every creature, it hath ſuch an obedientiall inſtinct to glorify God, as if it had reaſon to obey by; wherefore it is ſaide to groane to ſerve ſinne; the Land ſhall mourne, every fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a part: <hi>Zachar.</hi> 12. 12. As men mourne with reaſon at the crucifying of the Lord of life, ſo the Land it ſelfe mournes <hi>Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> at the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this is ſpoken <hi>ſuppoſedly or by</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>way of ſuppoſition.</hi> Every creature groaneth: that is, if they had reaſon, they would groane to be ſo miſuſed.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, the liquor that the drunkard abuſeth, if it had reaſon as well as a man to know how ſhamefully it is abuſed and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it would groane in the barrells againſt him: it would groane in the cup againſt him, it would groane in his throate and belly againſt him; it would flie in his face, if it could ſpeake, and crie out <hi>drunkard,</hi> out.</p>
                  <p>So if God ſhould open the mouth of the creatures, as he did open the mouth of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laans</hi> Aſſe: then, the proud mans garments on his backe would groane againſt him; there is never a creature but if it had reaſon to know how it is abuſed, till a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:121624:51"/> it would groane againſt man.</p>
                  <p>If the creature were conſcious of mans abuſe of it, then the Land would groane to beare us, the Aire would groane to give us breathing, our houſes would groane to lodge us, our beds would groane to eaſe us, our foode to feede us, our cloathes to cover us, and every creature would groane againſt us to give us any helpe or comfort, ſo long as we live in ſinne againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>intelligently,</hi> there is an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> aſſiſtance which runs along in every creature, as the heathen and ſchoole-men tell us. The power, goodneſſe and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, run along in them, giving being, quickening, preſerving, leading and governing &amp;c. So that a man cannot wrong the creature, but he wrongs God in the creature. And therefore becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and perſecuted the Church, Chriſt cals out from heaven to him, <hi>Why perſecuteſt thou me? Acts.</hi> 9. 4. Why? becauſe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Church, which was Chriſt his Church. As Chriſt is the head of his Church, ſo God hath made him the heire of all the creatures; all the creatures are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to Chriſt, and they are his: ſo that a man cannot wronge the creatures but he wrongeth Chriſt, and Chriſt groanes in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:121624:51"/> the creatures, againſt the drunkard, <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, why abuſeſt thou me?</hi> When the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man is coveting for the world, Chriſt cries in his barne, he cries in his Cheſt: Chriſt cries in his goods, <hi>Wretch, Wretch, why wrongeſt thou me?</hi> Doth a man abuſe his apparrell to pride? Chriſt groanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, <hi>Wretch, Wretch, why abuſeſt thou me?</hi> all the creatures are ſo inlivened, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, preſerved by God, that a man cannot meddle nor lay his hand on the creature, but he meddles with God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this is ſpoken <hi>ſpecifically:</hi> not of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the bleſſed Angells as <hi>Origen</hi> would have it, nor of men in generall as <hi>Auſtin</hi> would have it, becauſe man is a little world, and all creatures meete in him: But <hi>ſpecifically,</hi> every creature groaneth: that is, ſaith <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> and <hi>Hugo,</hi> and others, <hi>the goaly groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> and it is therefore ſaide every creature groaneth, becauſe the godly groane; every creature groaneth in the bowells of the Saints; they take the part of every creature, and come before God in the behalfe of the creatures, in their prayers, confeſſions, and humiliations, confeſſing how horribly and fearefully the creatures are abuſed, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning in their hearts for it.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how the creatures may be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:121624:52"/> ſaid to groane under the ſlavery of ſinne; Come we to the <hi>reaſons</hi> why the creatures are ſaid to groane under the ſlavery of ſin.</p>

                  <p>Needs muſt the creatures <hi>groane</hi> that is diſtracted in its ſervice. God would have one thing, and the wicked another.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>the ultimate and laſt end</hi> of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> creature, and that is Gods glory to glorifie God; every creature is then happy when it hath attained its end; but, the ſpecificall cannot be its happineſſe; for there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end beyond that.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ultimate</hi> end of a creature, as it is a creature, namely to ſet forth Gods glory, is more eſſentiall to it, then its owne ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall end, becauſe it hath this ſpecificall end onely in reference to the <hi>ultimate</hi> end.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if the creature be robbed of its <hi>laſt end,</hi> it is robbed of its <hi>being.</hi> The
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:121624:55"/> ſoule and heart of the creature is killed, and it is undone, when as it is taken from his <hi>ultimate</hi> end. It were as good that the world were no world, as that God have no glory by it: as good no earth, no corne, no cattell, as that God be not honoured by by it: A man no man, if he doe not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God: a creature no creature, if it doe not honour God: it is as much as if the creature were annihilated to its firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yea worſe: for, there is no evill in nothing, all evill is founded out of ſome good.</p>
                  <p>Hence it followeth, that a wicked man <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> hath no right to the creatures. For if the creatures were now of right belonging to the wicked, they would not groane under their ſervice: for every thing rejoyceth to be where of right it ſhould be. And a thing <hi>groanes</hi> when it is not in his proper place.</p>
                  <p>I deſire not to be miſconſtrued in this hard point: wicked men have a <hi>fivefold</hi> right to the creatures, which is as good as <hi>nothing</hi> without the <hi>ſixth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, they have a <hi>civill right:</hi> ſo <hi>Nabals</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſheep were ſaid to be his ſheep, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 4. And he was a theefe that ſhould have ſtolne them from him. A man is a thiefe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:121624:55"/> before God and man that robs a wicked man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>a providentiall right:</hi> that is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God by his providence may caſt the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in abundance upon a wicked man. Thus we ſee wicked men have lands, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and great poſſeſſions, corne and cattell, &amp;c. God by his providence caſteth them upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27. 5. God that made the Heavens and the earth with all creatures he diſtributes and diſpoſeth of them according to his owne will.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>a vindicative right</hi> from Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wrath: they may be inſtruments of his wrath, they may be able to execute the vengeance of God, as in the ſixth verſe of the forenamed place, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a wicked man, yet when the Lord would have him to execute his revenge upon <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> for <hi>Judahs</hi> ſinnes and rebellions againſt God, to this end the Lord delivered up all the Cattell, and all the Lands of <hi>Judah</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> hand, though in the end he vomits them up againe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>a wicked man may have a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <hi>right:</hi> a wicked man as he is <hi>a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſo he hath <hi>a creatures right</hi> to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For one creature depends on another, and helpes one another, and all joyne to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:121624:56"/> maintaine the life of man. God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded man that he ſhall not murther; and therefore he is not to murther himſelfe. Wherefore when he is hungry he muſt not ſtarve himſelfe, but muſt eate: when he is dry he muſt not choake himſelfe, but he muſt drinke, be he never ſo wicked.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly and laſtly, <hi>they have a filiall right</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                     <hi>to them,</hi> for God will have his grace and the Goſpel of his Son Chriſt to be offered unto them: he will have the wicked invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to faith and repentance; now this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unleſſe they ſhould live: they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be invited to faith unleſſe they a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life: and a naturall life they cannot have, if they ſhould have no naturall helps to uphold them therein, <hi>Pſal. 115. 16. The Heavens aae the Lords, but the earth hath he given to the children of men. Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, he hath given all the creatures to men in common, <hi>I have given them my crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures here below, that they might truſt in me above: that they may enter into the kingdom of Heaven at the laſt.</hi> This is a filiall right, when he that is not may be a Son of God: therefore God will have the Goſpell preached to the wicked. Now, if the wicked might not have the creatures, how could they come to Church? Alas, you
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:121624:56"/> were not able to ſit in your Pews and to heare the Goſpell preached, if you might not have the creatures.</p>
                  <p>But beloved, all theſe rights are nothing without another <hi>right.</hi> The creatures may groane in their hands: theſe make their doome and damnation the greater, and the bondage and miſery of the creature the greater, that the creature ſhould help man to come to Chriſt, and then he will not have him: that the creature hath fed and nouriſhed ſuch a one that he might repent, but he will not: that the creature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him life, light and ſtrength to lead him to faith, but he will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> believe: O, <hi>then,</hi> the creature fetcheth ſuch a <hi>groane</hi> as that it makes all the world to ring with it, and God heares the <hi>groanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A wicked man hath no <hi>filiall</hi> right to the creatures, they have no Son-like right in Chriſt: they have a <hi>filiable</hi> right, becauſe they are invited to be his Sons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but as long as they live in their ſinnes they are none of his ſonnes, neither have they any filiall right.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, mans firſt <hi>Charter</hi> is out of doubt loſt, by reaſon of ſinne; all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are fallen by <hi>lapſe</hi> into the hands of God the owner againe. Now Chriſt is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:121624:57"/> our chiefe Lord, he is made the Heire of all things, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 1. And the wicked that are not new creatures in Chriſt, in regard of <hi>filiall right,</hi> they are but incroachers; and therefore every creature groanes in their fingers, and every thing that they have, groanes to be theirs; their very meate groans in their bellies, their ſleep groanes in their heads, their breath groanes in their lungs: yea, the very blood groanes in their veines, and woe is them that they have not <hi>eares</hi> to heare <hi>theſe</hi> groanes.</p>
                  <p>Though God give them Tables, and fill them with abundance, yet he raines his fierce wrath and vengeance upon their meate while they are eating, <hi>Job</hi> 20. 23. God will make them reſtore <hi>every</hi> creature they have; they ſhall make reſtitution as oppreſſors of the poore creatures, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. and their meat ſhall be turned into the gall of Aſpes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. for the very creatures ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt them, and condemne them: we know that <hi>every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture groaneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, this may teach us that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>wicked have little cauſe to be merry at any time,</hi> becauſe there is nothing about them, nor in them, nor before them, but groaneth againſt them. Every creature that they have
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:121624:57"/> groanes becauſe it is poſſeſſed by them: not ſome kinde of creatures, but <hi>every</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Theophylact</hi> obſerves, every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture groaneth againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou live in thy ſinnes, and yet art merry? thou art madde. Doſt thou live in thy carnall eſtate and condition, and yet canſt rejoyce? thou art ſurely beſides thy ſelfe. For who can be merry in the midſt of thouſand thouſands of groanes? Thy Apparell groanes, thy Laces, thy Silkes, and thy Braveries groane, till either thou beeſt a <hi>new</hi> creature, or elſe beeſt in hell. Thy houſe and thy ſtuffe, thy barne and thy ſtore doe groane, till either thou be a Convert or in <hi>Tophet.</hi> Every penny in thy purſe, every ragge on thy backe, yea thy fleſh and thy bones, yea thine owne ſoule and thy ſpirits as they are Gods creatures, and take his part, <hi>they all</hi> groane againſt thee till thou beeſt cut off.</p>
                  <p>Not onely all thy ſinnes, all thy oathes, lies, vaine ſpeeches; not onely every ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from Church, every idle thought, every unprofitable word, every Sermon that thou haſt heard without profit, every exhortation thou haſt heard without bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, every ſickneſſe thou haſt had without reformation, every day of patience thou
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:121624:58"/> haſt enjoyed without repentance, not onely all theſe doe groane againſt thee: but alſo <hi>every</hi> creature in heaven and in earth, they doe all groane and travell in paine to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of thy ſlavery. Whatſoever thou doeſt, the creatures groane and complaine againſt thee. How then canſt thou rejoyee, or have merry day? I have ſaide of this joy it is madde: and doſt thou rejoyce? thy rejoycing ſhall be ſhort. <hi>Job.</hi> 20. 5.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, needs muſt a wicked man have wrath and vengeance powred downe upon him; for all creatures <hi>groane</hi> to God for his vengeance and deſtruction. The creatures crie unto God, Lord, plague this man: Lord, ſhower downe thy curſes on him: he hath abuſed and wronged me: Lord, let not ſuch a rebell as that man is, eſcape, but in thy juſtice be avenged on him for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of us.</p>
                  <p>Weepe and howle rather then thou ſecure and impenitent perſon; let this be a <hi>Cora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſime</hi> to thy pleaſanteſt luſt, and as an <hi>Arrow</hi> ſhot into thy heart to let out the life and bloud of all thy ſinnes and corruptions, <hi>to thinke of this.</hi> And in the feare of God take heede, how thou goeſt on in thy ſinnes, in thy abuſe of Gods creatures, leaſt thereby thou forcing the creatures to groane for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groane,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:121624:58"/> they pull downe the wrath and plagues of God upon <hi>thy</hi> head.</p>
                  <p>Oh what a terrour is this to the wicked; every creature <hi>groanes:</hi> not in compaſſion for thee, nor in fellow-feeling with thee, as with the godly, but in <hi>indignation</hi> againſt thee.</p>
                  <p>The horſes, and the bridles, they ſhould have written upon them <hi>holineſſe in the Lord Zach.</hi> 14. 20. this is a Propheſie of the Churches holineſſe under Chriſt, not as <hi>Theode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> adplies it to <hi>Hellena,</hi> who adorned her horſe-trappings with the nailes of Chriſt his croſſe. <hi>Hierome</hi> refuits that; but, to ſhew that Chriſt he will have even the horſes and bridles, and all and <hi>every</hi> thing for a <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe;</hi> ſo the ſilly horſes and even the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles doe groane and pronounce woe unto the ungodly riders that feare not God.</p>
                  <p>Every pot in <hi>Judah,</hi> and every bowle in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be holy unto the Lord, ver. 12. The drinking pots and bowles doe groane, woe be unto him that drinkes, and lives not a godly life: yea the very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhall be called the <hi>ways of holines, I ſay</hi> 35. 8. the ways and the pathes groane under all that goe on them and are not holy.</p>
                  <p>There is no creature <hi>above</hi> or <hi>beneath</hi> as <hi>Porſper</hi> ſpeaketh, which doth profeſſe the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:121624:59"/> praiſe of God, and therefore every creature conteſteth againſt thee that prayſeſt not God. The Angels and all the Hoaſt of Heaven prayſe God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. the Sunne, the Moone and the ſtarres prayſe God, the heavens and the waters that be above the heavens prayſe God: the earth, the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and all the deepes, fire and haile &amp;c. Kings of the earth, &amp;c. <hi>all theſe</hi> ſing forth the prayſes of God. And therefore they all groane againſt him that prayſeth him not.</p>
                  <p>Better were it for thee to have all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells in hell againſt thee, then to have the groanes of Gods creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee. I would rather have all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells in hell, and all the wicked in the world againſt mee, then the leaſt worme or duſt of the earth to groane in the eares of the Lord againſt me.

                  <p>If you be covetous and earthly, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt needs groane under this wrong.

                  <p>It was the ſaying of an Ancient, that, that man is blinde, deafe, ſenceleſſe, bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, that knows not God. Thou canſt not ſee a creature, but thou mayeſt ſee God:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:121624:64"/> thou canſt not feele a creature, but thou maieſt feele God: thou canſt not ſmell, not taſte, nor meddle with a creature, but thou mayeſt ſmell and taſte God in the creature: thou canſt not behold a creature, but thou mayeſt behold God in the creature.</p>
                  <p>O ſaith one, if I could ſee God as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Fathers, then I ſhould obey him, and feare him, and truſt in him, and love him.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, God appeares now as he did then. How did God appeare to <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> &amp;c. and to all the holy Patriarches and Prophets? Did God appear to them in his owne Eſſence and nature? No, it is impoſſible that any ſhould ſee God and live. When God appeared to them and ſhewed himſelf to them, he did it <hi>in a creature: And</hi> I pray you, doth not God appeare thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us now? God having made man to behold by ſence, by ſight, hearing, ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, taſting, handling; that all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he hath, he muſt have it by theſe; God makes as it were an apparition of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; he takes the likeneſſe as it were of the Sunne, Moon, and ſtarres, and therein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares; he takes the Cattle, plants, &amp;c. and therein appeares: therein he ſhews ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelfe: thou never ſeeſt any
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:121624:65"/> creature but it is the appearance of God to thoe: the whole world is an apparition of God to thee; God appears in the heavens, in the earth, and in every creature. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thou lookeſt on any of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, thou makeſt not an holy uſe of them, beholding God in them, uſing them as a riſe to winde up thy heart and ſoule to God; then thou abuſeſt the creatures, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt them to <hi>groane</hi> againſt thee. For, <hi>we know that the whole creation groaneth and travelleth in paine till this preſent.</hi>

                  <p>A ſcholer writes as his maſters coppie directs him: he begins every line as his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter begins, he ends as he ends, he ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to frame every letter as his maſter fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, to joyne letters and ſyllables toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as his maſter joyned them together.

                  <p>You may read that this was Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he laid downe in himſelfe from all eternity before the foundation of the world was laid; when he predeſtinated that his Son ſhould come into the world, he predeſtinated that all that ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by him, ſhould be conformable to the image of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he did foreknow with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of <hi>Love</hi> and predeſtination, them he did predeſtinate to be made like unto Chriſt; that looke what Chriſt was by <hi>nature,</hi> they might be by <hi>grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this be the end of Gods predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then it is impoſſible that any man ſhould be in Chriſt, and not have the image of Chriſt; <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that as Chriſt was holy by nature: ſo thoſe that are predeſtinate, ſhould be holy by grace.</p>
                  <p>God ſhall never be fruſtrated of his end and purpoſe. If God have purpoſed it, who ſhall fruſtrate it? Man indeed may
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:121624:71"/> be fruſtrated of his end, becauſe of his weakneſſe and inability to accompliſh by himſelfe what he purpoſeth; ſome other perſon or thing prevents him of his end.

                  <p>We may conclude that that man that prayeth for mercy, and wiſheth <hi>Oh that I might have redemption by Chriſt, Oh that I meght goe to Heaven,</hi> and yet lives in his ſinnes and ſlavery to his luſts: he prayeth to have benefit by Chriſt, and to goe to Heaven in ſpight of God, againſt the will and purpoſe of God.</p>
                  <p>God hath predeſtinated that all that ſhall have life &amp; glory, ſhall be made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Son; that they ſhall be holy, pure, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Our owne conſciences may tell us, that God cannot be fruſtrated of his end and purpoſe: but that thus we muſt be made conformable to Chriſt, or elſe we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have benefitt or ſalvation by him: or elſe Gods purpoſe would be fruſtrated and in vaine.</p>

                  <p>If ever thou beeſt in Chriſt, thou muſt walke as Chriſt walked; thou muſt be a Chriſtian like to that good Martyr, who to all demands anſwered that he was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.

                  <p>As in a mans body, there be veines, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and nerves, that are the channells to convey life, and motion and ſence to every member, that all the members may have the ſame life diſperſed through the body. So it is in the body of Chriſt: every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt hath <hi>fayth</hi> for his veines, to convey the ſame life, and the ſame ſpirits, and the ſame gratious motions to all the body, that it is not now the member that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:121624:73"/> lives, but Chriſt that lives in it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. I live not, ſaith the Apoſtle, but Chriſt liveth in me. As in the body, it is not the eye that ſeeth, if we ſpeake properly, but the man that ſeeth with the eye: ſo it is not the knife that cuts, but the man that cuts with the knife; it is not the eare that heareth, but the man that heareth with the eare: ſo in the body of Chriſt, it is no more the man that ſpeaketh, but the truth of Chriſt ſpeaking in him. <hi>We have the minde of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. if we be in Chriſt, Chriſt thinks in us, Chriſt ſpeaks in us, Chriſt walkes in us, Chriſt doth all in us: As in the ſame body, the ſoule rules and quickens every member. The body of Chriſt cannot be a monſter, like thoſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts ſpoken off <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. 7. that had ſhapes like horſes, heads as it were like Crownes of gold, and their faces like the faces of a man, and had haire like women, and teeth like Lyons; this is a monſter, and not a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple body: ſuch a one cannot the body of Chriſt be; a mocker for one member, an ignorant ſot for another, an hypocrite for another, a carnall goſpeller for another, a covetous worldling for another.</p>
                  <p>As in the body of a man, every member in this mans body, muſt be this mans mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:121624:74"/> and not the member of another man: As for example, <hi>Peter</hi> muſt have <hi>Peters</hi> legs, and not <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his legs: <hi>Peter</hi> muſt have <hi>Peters</hi> eyes, and not <hi>Alexanders</hi> eyes: <hi>Peter</hi> muſt have <hi>Peters</hi> hands, and not <hi>Judas</hi> hands: you cannot take the eye of an Horſe, the leg of a Dog, and the paw of a Beare, and put them together, and ſay here's a man: no, this would be a monſter: every perfect body muſt have its own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>So it is in the body of Chriſt: every member in Chriſt his Body, muſt have Chriſt his Members: every member in a mans body acts with reaſon, ſo every member of Chriſt acts with direction of Chriſt it is informed by Chriſt, his minde is quickned by Chriſt his life: ſo that a man cannot be a member of Chriſt, but he muſt walke as Chriſt walked.</p>
                  <p>I know, the beſt Chriſtian may fall ſeven times a day, though he be in Chriſt: it doth not therefore follow that every particular action ſavours of Chriſt: but, as every member in the body lives the life of the whole body, or elſe it is a dead member: ſo thou muſt live the life of Chriſt, or elſe thou canſt never be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>You know that all the actions of a man
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:121624:74"/> are guided by reaſon: yet there are ſome particular actions that he doth, and not by reaſon: as it may be he ſhakes his head, or moves his hand, and jogs his foote, and conſiders not what he doth: they are the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a <hi>reaſonable</hi> man, though not <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> actions: ſo, there may be many acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are the actions of Chriſtians, though not Chriſtian actions. The ſinnes of the godly, they are the actions of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but they are not Chriſtian actions: there may be ſtoppings in the body: though the ſame life and quickening runnes through the whole body: yet through the ſtopping of the liver and the pipes, diſtempers and ill humours may be raiſed in the body; ſo it may be in the body of Chriſt: and ſo many a Chriſtian may fall through infirmity; but, the courſe of a Chriſtian, the life of a Chriſtian, the ordinary trade of a Chriſtian, the walke of a Chriſtian is to live with the ſame ſpirit that lived in Chriſt, to walke in the ſame way that Chriſt walked in.</p>

                  <p>Is it ſo that all that are in Chriſt, walke <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Theſe blaſpheme the holy and ſacred name of Chriſt. Oh ſaith one, I hope I am a Chriſtian: yet the man is a drunkard, or a whoremaſter, or a gameſter, or a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a proud man, a covetous man.

                  <p>Beloved, is any man a Chriſtian? he hath holineſſe engraven in his forehead to the Lord, in his heart, in his thoughts, in his words, and in all his wayes: he is one that <hi>gaſpeth</hi> after holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Art thou a Chriſtian? of all ſinnes under Heaven God cannot endure the ſinnes of a Chriſtian that hath the name of Chriſt put upon him. When Gods materiall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was defiled by buyers and ſellers, Chriſt whippes them out, and after told them that the days would come wherein there ſhould not be left of it one ſtone upon another.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:121624:76"/> God would not endure the Temple becauſe it was dedicated to his Name, called his houſe, when it was made a den of theeves. Doth God care ſo much for ſtocks and ſtones, that are dedicated to his name? will he not endure an unholy ſtone, and will he endure an unholy Chriſtian? Thou that art dedicated unto God, and unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, thou that art dedicated to prayer, to hearing, thou that art dedicated to an holy converſation, thou that art called the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and the Houſe of God, wilt thou make it a denne of theeves, a denne of vaine thoughts, a denne of wicked words, of dead and ungodly workes? wilt thou defile the Temple of the Lord? then know, the Lord will not let one ſtone lie upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but will caſt thee downe and damn thee body and ſoule in hell for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſaieſt thou art a Chriſtian; how ſo? thou ſaieſt thou waſt chriſtened: thy condemnation is the heavier, if thou ſaieſt thou haſt beene baptized into the Name of Chriſt, and haſt not put on Chriſt.

                  <p>Can I ſay that man hath <hi>put on</hi> his cloths, that hath not a ragge on his backe, nor a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:121624:77"/> ſhoe on his foote, nor a hatte to his head, nor a ring on his finger? ſo, when there is never a Chriſt in thy thoughts, never a Chriſt in thy ſpeech and conference, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Chriſt in thy walke, never a Chriſt in thy calling, in thy buying and ſelling, never a Chriſt ſhining forth in thy life and converſation, canſt thou ſay thou haſt put on the Lord Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Can any man ſay that a beggar hath put on Royall robes, when he hath nothing but ragges and patches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon him? ſo, if I ſee a man with ragged thoughts of the world, with ragged ſpeeches of the fleſh, and a ragged courſe and converſation, according to the courſe and converſation of the world, I can never ſay that ſuch a one hath put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou ſay thou haſt put on Chriſt? why then, ſhew me the ſignes of Chriſt in thee. Shall I ſee it by thine apparell? it may be that is gariſh. Shall I ſee it by thy ſpeech and conference? it may be that is earthly and carnall. Shall I ſee it by thy thoughts? it may be they are vaine, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and worldly. Shall I ſee it by thy company? it may be they are wicked and graceleſſe. Shall I ſee it in thy courſe and converſation? it may be that is looſe and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:121624:77"/> prophane. How canſt thou then demonſtrate that thou art a Chriſtian? it may be now and then thou wilt give a prayer unto Chriſt, turne up the white of thine eye to Chriſt, it may be thou wilt looke into the Temple of Chriſt, and lend an eare to Chriſt. Is this to be in Chriſt? if thou be in Chriſt, then thou muſt live the life of Chriſt in <hi>all</hi> thy wayes.</p>
                  <p>The life of a man is a continued thing. A man is not alive at his dinner, and dead when he hath done: alive at his worke, and dead when his worke is done; ſo it is not enough for thee to prove that thou art in Chriſt, that thou art alive at prayer, or at preaching: life is a <hi>continued</hi> thing: thou muſt be alive after prayer as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, alive after the Sermon as well as whilſt thou art at it, if thou haſt the life of Chriſt in thee; it is a ſtanding life: it will not make thee alive at prayer, and dead when thou haſt done: it will not make thee holy and ſpirituall at a Sermon, and leave thee dead and carnall when it is done: not holy and heavenly in a diſcourſe and conference, and worldly and prophane when it is done: not to be holy and lively &amp;c. in a good moode, and leave thee dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, ſecure and looſe afterwards; this

And this commiſſion God gives unto all his Miniſters: <hi>Marke.</hi> 16. 15. Goe, preach the Goſpell <hi>to</hi> every creature: he doth not ſay preach the Goſpell <hi>before</hi> every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:121624:78"/> ſo they may doe, and preach in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: but <hi>to</hi> every creature, that every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may feele the Goſpell beating on his heart, that every creature may ſee his ſins, that ſo the Goſpell may be applyed to his heart.</p>
                  <p>All the names given to Miniſters, ſhew thus much. They are called <hi>Seeds-men:</hi> now, a Seeds-man doth not take a whole coppe, or a whole buſhell of corne and throw it in a heape in his field; but he takes it and ſcatters it abroade, that every place may receive ſome.</p>
                  <p>So, they are called <hi>Builders;</hi> now, a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der doth not onely frame the whole buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but he layes every particular bricke, and every particular ſtone in his building.</p>
                  <p>So, they are called <hi>Shepheards;</hi> a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard doth not onely looke to his flocke in generall, but to every Ram, and to every Lambe in his flocke.</p>
                  <p>So, Preachers muſt not onely preach the word of God in generall, but they muſt preach in particular.</p>
                  <p>The ground of this will appeare, if we conſider three things in particular.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>particulars are moſt operative;</hi> it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not fire in generall that burnes, but is this or that fire: ſo it is not ſinne in generall, that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:121624:79"/> will humble a man: it is not repentance in generall that will turne a man: it is not fayth in generall that will ſave a man: but, <hi>this</hi> ſinne and that ſinne: <hi>this</hi> repentance and that repentance: <hi>this</hi> fayth and that fayth.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>actions</hi> they are of <hi>ſingulars.</hi> A <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall</hi> man cannot <hi>reaſon,</hi> a univerſall man cannot <hi>diſpute,</hi> a univerſall man cannot <hi>ſee,</hi> nor <hi>heare.</hi> No, it is <hi>this</hi> man, and <hi>that</hi> man that ſeeth and heares, and diſputes. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are moſt operative: preaching to men in particular, is powerfull preaching: that workes upon mens conſciences. How came the Prophet to preach powerfully to the people? <hi>He declared to Jacob his ſinne, and to Jſraell his tranſgreſsion:</hi> Micha. 3. 8. <hi>I am full of power, by the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Spirit of the Lord,</hi> ſayth the Prophet; <hi>here</hi> was the way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Prophet preached powerfully; ſo that the Spirit went and <hi>rent</hi> mens hearts and conſciences, and made them tremble; how? why he made every ſoule ſee his ſinnes: ſo, that Miniſter that would preach powerfully to the conſciences of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he muſt make <hi>every one</hi> of them to ſee <hi>their</hi> ſinnes againſt God, and his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, ſo that they may confeſſe <hi>I ſee I have beene a greivous ſinner,</hi> and I am in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:121624:79"/> the ſtate of damnation: <hi>and</hi> I muſt repent, or elſe I ſhall be damned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>particulars are moſt diſtinct;</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when the preacher preacheth only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, it workes a confuſed knowledge, knowledge of ſinne in generall: a confuſed repentance, a confuſed humiliation, and a confuſed fayth in the generall; it may be, it may make a man ſee he is a ſinner in the generall: but there are many thouſand thouſand ſinnes in particular that he takes no notice of, but ſwallowes them downe in the generall: it may be his ſinnes may be diſcovered in the generall: but alas, there are many yea multitudes of deceits, of turnings and windings of the heart in particular, that are never diſcovered to them. All the religion of theſe men, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generall: I love God with all my heart, <hi>ſayth one:</hi> and yet the man is groſſely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God. Aske him any particulars, how he can prove his love to God, and the man cannot ſhew any. So, I ſerve God with all my heart: but goe to particulars, and bid him manifeſt what he ſpeakes; ſo, I feare God, I worſhip God: but bring them to the <hi>particular</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>orkes of theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and they are gone preſently, they are loſt, and know not what to anſwer.</p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:121624:80"/>
                  <p>Thus the people in <hi>Malachies</hi> time, they thought they had much knowledge while the Preiſt preached thus overly to them; but when the Prophet came to preach <hi>home,</hi> and to come with <hi>particulars</hi> to them, they thought the Prophet was madde, they knew not what he meant. <hi>You have deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet; <hi>wherein?</hi> ſay they: <hi>Malac. 1. 6. You have prophaned the worſhippe</hi> of God, <hi>You have polluted the table of the Lord,</hi> ſayth the Prophet: ver. 7. <hi>wherein?</hi> ſaid they. <hi>You have wearied the Lord with your words,</hi> ſaid the Prophet. Chapt. 2. ver. 17. <hi>wherein?</hi> ſaid they. <hi>You have robbed God.</hi> Chapt. 3. ver. 8. <hi>wherein?</hi> ſaid they. <hi>See, your words have beene ſtoute againſt the Lord,</hi> ſaid the Prophet; yet they ſaid <hi>what have we ſpoken?</hi> ver. 13. they could not tell <hi>wherein,</hi> till the Prophet told them, <hi>herein</hi> have you robbed God, <hi>herein</hi> have you deſpiſed the Lord, <hi>herein</hi> you have prophaned the worſhippe of God &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So, ſhould the Miniſter of God come to men, and tell them in particular, <hi>thou</hi> art an enemy to Gods grace, <hi>thou</hi> haſt abuſed Gods patience; <hi>wherein?</hi> ſayeſt thou. <hi>Thou</hi> art one that ſcorneſt the word of God, and <hi>thou</hi> defileſt all the Ordinances of God. <hi>Wherein?</hi> ſayeſt thou. <hi>Thou</hi> art one that putſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:121624:80"/> farre from thee the evill day, wherein? ſayeſt thou.</p>
                  <p>Now, when the Miniſter of God can come to <hi>particulars,</hi> and ſhew men <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;</hi> then they crye out againſt them, and thinke they tell them lies, and preach falſe things to them: but the Miniſters of God are bound to preach ſo as they may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mens particular ſinnes, not ſo as people may point one at another, but ſo as every conſcience may feele its <hi>owne</hi> ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly <hi>particulars are moſt ſenſible.</hi> If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Miniſter preach home in <hi>particular,</hi> there is not a falſe heart then in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but he will finde it out; if he preach in particular, he will diſcover every mans corruption, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When he preacheth of <hi>mens ſinnes</hi> and corruptions: he muſt preach ſo that their conſciences may ſee that the word of God lookes into the very thoughts and hearts; when he preacheth of the <hi>wrath
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:121624:81"/> of God,</hi> and of condemnation &amp;c. he muſt preach ſo, that the conſcience may feele e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the fire of hell flaming in it; this is the way to teach the people <hi>the good knowledge of the Lord,</hi> as it is called: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 22. every Miniſter may teach the knowledge of the Lord, but not the <hi>good</hi> knowledge of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>There is great difference betweene teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>knowledge,</hi> and of the <hi>good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the Lord. Men may know God and his word, and their ſinnes: but if they goe on in their ſins, it is not good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: then indeede a Miniſter teacheth good knowledge, when he makes his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo to know ſinne, as to loath it, and to come out of it; ſo to know repentance as to repent indeed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Diſcrimination.</hi> As if he ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſay there are ſome that are <hi>in him,</hi> and ſome that are not <hi>in him:</hi> if any man ſay <hi>he abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in him,</hi> he ought himſelfe to walk even as he walked: ſo that here the Apoſtle would put a difference betweene the ſound and the rotten-hearted in his congregation.</p>

                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>Mans naturall eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:121624:85"/> ever he ſhould be ſaved, that ever he ſhould get grace or come within the liſt of eternall life. Chriſt ſayth it, and bindeth it with an oath: ver. 3. <hi>Verely, verely, I ſay unto thee, except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God:</hi> much leſſe inherit it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is <hi>Gods gracious proviſion</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>which he hath taken with the world,</hi> that though man were in a way of damnation, <hi>invincibly;</hi> yet now he is put in a way of <hi>probability</hi> of ſalvation: ver. 16. though he were unſalvable by nature, yet now he is ſalvable by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here is <hi>a generall proclamation</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>upon the condition of fayth,</hi> that this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility may be attained if a man beleeve. In the ſame verſe, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoever beleeveth in him, &amp;c.</hi> It is a condition of faith, put to all, none excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Whoſoever he be that beleeveth in Chriſt, he ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, here is <hi>the reprobation of the</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <hi>world;</hi> he that beleeveth not, is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already. The cauſe whereof cannot be caſt on Chriſt, for, <hi>God hath not ſent his Son to condemne the world, but that the world tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough him might be ſaved:</hi> It was Chriſts <hi>primary</hi> purpoſe, and the firſt end of his
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:121624:85"/> coming, <hi>to ſave the world:</hi> it is an <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> end or rather an event of his coming, that the world is <hi>condemned.</hi> Chriſt is not the cauſe of it: he is not the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe, for he is a Saviour: nor the <hi>deficient</hi> cauſe, for he is a ſufficient Saviour.</p>
                  <p>That the cauſe of their condemnation, is from themſelves, and not from Chriſt: is proved by three arguments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>from their owne conſciences:</hi> he that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> beleeveth not, is condemned already. He cannot here ſpeake of the condemnation of hell, for he is not in hell already. But he ſpeaks of an apprehenſiall condemnation in their owne conſciences: as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerves, he meanes the condemnation of their owne conſciences; he that beleeves not, his conſcience tells him that it is his fault that he beleeveth not: though it be not in his power to beleeve, yet God hath gone ſo farre, he hath ſo farre ſtrugled with mens conſciences, that there is no default on his part: They cannot excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying, I have no power to beleeve: their owne conſciences will tell them that God hath knocked at their hearts, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them power to beleeve, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it They cannot ſay I know not how to beleeve; his owne conſcience will tell
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:121624:86"/> him that God hath offered inſtruction to him, whereby he might have beene taught, but that he refuſed it: ſo that he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves not, is condemned already; his own conſcience riſeth within him, and tells him that it is his owne fault that he doth not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>it is proved by experience;</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſhews that men are the cauſe of their owne condemnation: ver. 19. <hi>This is the conde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> nation that light is come into the world, but men loved darkeneſſe rather then light;</hi> the meaning of it, is this, <hi>This</hi> is the cauſe of condemnation to the world; not Gods predeſtination, not their fatall deſtiny, not their breach of the firſt covenant, nor any other impiety, but <hi>this ſinne of Infidelity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the world ſtood guilty of never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes: yet, if it did beleeve in the Lord. Jeſus, it ſhould be ſaved. So that it is not all the other ſinnes that a man commits, that damnes him: but his infidelity that that layes all his former ſinnes that ever he committed upon him; <hi>here</hi> is condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that though light be come into the world, to pull men out of their darkeneſſe, and ſinnes; yea though Chriſt, though grace come to them, yet they will not come out of their ſinnes: men will not have
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:121624:86"/> Chriſt, men will not have grace, men love darkeneſſe rather then light.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is proved by reaſon, ver. 6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the verſe now read unto you. For, <hi>every man that doth evill, hateth the light: neither cometh to the light, leaſt his deedes ſhould be reproved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is <hi>a ſtrong argument</hi> to prove that if men be damned, themſelves are the cauſe of it: for if light come into the world to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct men, if Chriſt come into the world to plucke men out of their ſinnes, if Chriſt come with his bloud and ſpirit to cleanſe and ſanctifie men, and men will not be ſanctified: <hi>Then,</hi> if they periſh in their ſins, they are juſtly guiltie of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                  <p>The words comprehend in them two things.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>cauſe of the wickeds rejection</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>So that there be <hi>foure</hi> things in a wicked mans hatred of the word.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>it is an actuall hatred:</hi> for there is an <hi>habituall</hi> hatred of the word, even in them that never heard the word; they doe not <hi>actually</hi> hate it, becauſe they never had it; but they would hate it if they had it; as ſore eyes hate the light of the Sunne even when it is downe; for if they had it, they would twinckle at it. Thus all wicked men hate the word, and may be condemned for deſpiſers of the word, though they doe not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:121624:87"/> actually hate it, becauſe they have it not; yet <hi>habitually</hi> they hate it; they would hate it if they had it. I ſpeake not of this hatred, but of that which is actuall hatred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by though they have the word, yet they hate to be controled, and reformed by the word: <hi>Prov. 1. 22. O yee fooles, how long will ye hate knowledge?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>it is a paſsion of the heart,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſo I diſtinguiſh it: for I know a wicked man may love the word of God with his underſtanding and conſcience; his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may love the word and ſay it is good; his conſcience may love the word and ſay it is gratious; yet if he cutts not off his ſinnes for the word, he hates it. <hi>Pſal. 119. 70. Their heart is as fat as greaſe, but my delight is in thy law;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, my heart is a leane heart, an hungrie heart, my ſoule delighteth and rejoyceth in and loveth thy word: I have nothing elſe to fill it but thy word, and the comforts I have from it: but their hearts are as fat as greaſe, their hearts are fat hearts, fat with the world, fat with luſt, they hate the word.</p>
                  <p>As a full ſtomacke <hi>loatheth</hi> meate and cannot digeſt it: ſo wicked men <hi>hate</hi> the word, it will not goe downe with them, it will not fetch up their luſts.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:121624:88"/>
                  <p>If thou parteſt not with thy ſinnes, thy heart hateth the word: yet thou thinkeſt thou loveſt the word: thou fayeſt thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt to heare the word, and thou loveſt good Miniſters, and good diſcourſes, &amp;c. it may be that this is nothing but the aſſent of thine underſtanding, and the approbation of thy conſcience, and ſo a man may love the word in his underſtanding and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and yet be a hater of the word of God.</p>
                  <p>The Devills have attained to ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity as this, they like the word in their underſtandings, and aſſent to the truth of it in their conſciences; but though their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings and conſciences tell them that it is a good word: yet they hate it. This is a damnable and a moſt unnaturall hatred.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if a mans mind and conſcience were againſt the word, it were naturall for him to hate it: it is naturall for a man to hate that which is againſt his mind: but when thy conſcience ſhall tell thee, this is the word and the will of the Eternall God; and thy conſcience ſhall tell thee, that it is a moſt true word, a righteous, a juſt, an holy commandement that commands thee to ſerve thy God onely, and ſo to part with all thy ſinnes; if yet thou wilt not obey,

                     <hi>heart riſeth up againſt an union with the word:</hi> hatred is a ſhunning of an union with a thing. A man doth not hate any evill natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but he hates an union with it. A man doth not hate poiſon it ſelfe, he hates no poiſon in a toade: let it be there as much as it will, he cares not; ſo the ſhepheard, he hates not the wolfe in the Forreſt, but in the Flocke. A wicked man hates not the word ſo long as it keepes within it ſelfe; he loves Epiſtles and Goſpells, the firſt and ſecond leſſon: ſo long as the word keepes in the Scriptures, he likes it; but if the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to take union with him, if the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to plucke ſinne from him, to pull his cupps from him, to plucke his pleaſures and delights from him, and his luſts from him,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:121624:89"/> then he hates the word, when it comes in this union to his heart.</p>
                  <p>I put this union of the <hi>word</hi> in oppoſition to foure things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>againſt generall preaching;</hi> a wicked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> man loves generall preaching, though it be of all the truthes in the Bible, while they take no union with his heart; he may heare a thouſand Sermons and like them all well enough; ſo long as the word cloſeth not in with a mans conſcience, ſo long as it grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not with his heart, ſo long he may love and like it. But let the word come in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to him, and tell him this is <hi>thy</hi> ſinne, and <hi>thou</hi> muſt to hell for it, if thou giveſt it not over: this hath beene an old luſt of thine which will be thy bane if thou repent not: This thy old corruption, it will be thy breake-necke if thou part not with it: if the word come in this union with his ſoule, then he hates it.</p>
                  <p>So long as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> tooke his text, and dwelt on the reaſons, and went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Herod</hi> heard him gladly: but when <hi>John</hi> came to his uſe to apply it, and told him in particular, this reproves thee <hi>Herod,</hi> and all the evills that ever thou haſt done, and in particular for thine unlawfull marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with thy brother <hi>Philips</hi> wife: when
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:121624:89"/> 
                     <hi>John</hi> came thus, then <hi>Herod</hi> claps him up in priſon; before he heard him with joy and gladneſſe: but when he comes cloſe to his conſcience, and tells him that his marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age would condemne him, and his other ſinnes would damme him, if he repented not; <hi>Herod</hi> cannot endure this preaching any longer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>in oppoſition to mercifull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A wicked man loves mercifull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; why? it takes no union with his heart, it is like a Plaiſter that will never ſticke. A mercifull Sermon can never ſticke on a prophane heart; it is likened to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie paper that will never faſten, ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sermons, they will never faſten: on his heart, they cannot take away his ſinnes from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ahab</hi> he loved his foure hundred meale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthed mercifull Preachers well enough; but when <hi>Micaiah</hi> came to him, <hi>O, I hate him, for he never Propheſieth good unto me but evill,</hi> he is alwayes upon hell-ſtrings, he is alwayes preaching judgement unto me: I cannot claw off one of his Sermons in a month ſcarſe, I cannot catch hold on any of his Points to comfort my heart; there is not one ſentence in all his Sermons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh my conſcience, he never propheſieth
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:121624:90"/> good unto me but evill; I hate him.</p>
                  <p>When a Miniſter comes to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a man, and tells him this is the truth of God, and this is <hi>thy ſinne</hi> and <hi>damnation,</hi> and makes his Sermons ſticke as a burre on his conſcience, and as an arrow ſhot into his bowells, his heart riſith againſt it, and hee cannot endure it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>in oppoſition to Preaching when the Miniſter is dead.</hi> A wicked man loves the word when he that preacheth it is dead. Why? then there is none to urge a union of the Word with his conſcience. A wicked man loves to read Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>John,</hi> &amp;c. why? theſe men are not alive to urge a union of the word with their conſciences; but if Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. were alive to tell them, if this be the word of God, then thou art a damned man, if thou doeſt not obey it: if this be a grace, then thou art a curſed man, if thou have it not: if theſe men were alive now, their Sermons would cut to the quicke. So when the Miniſters are dead, men love to buy their bookes, and to read their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
                  <p>Now Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> is dead, all the world honours him, and men buy up his bookes; but when he was alive, the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:121624:90"/> made ballads of him, and profane <hi>Belials</hi> would make ſongs of him: why? they could not endure this union of the word. If the Miniſter be by, he cannot be drunke, but the Miniſter will preach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to him for it, if he repent not; he cannot ſweare, or lie, or deceive, but the Miniſter will tell him that this will be a core to his conſcience another day. Men cannot endure this. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c, being dead they like well enough; but if they were alive, they would hate them: why? they cannot endure an union with the word.</p>
                  <p>This was the religion of the Scribes and Phariſees: <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 29, 30. they built the tombes of the Prophets, and garniſhed the Sepulchers of the righteous, and ſaid if they had lived in the dayes of their fathers, they would not have bin partakers with them in the bloud of the Prophets. You are the children of thoſe men that killed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſayth Chriſt: ver. 31. Are not you the children of thoſe men? doe not you doe thoſe ſinnes which the Prophets cried out againſt, and for which the Prophets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſuch fearefull judgements upon them? I tell you if the Prophets were now alive, they would crie hell and damnation,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:121624:91"/> to you: if the Prophets were now alive, and did ſee thoſe ſinnes you commit, they would denounce woe and vengeance to you as they did to their fathers.</p>
                  <p>Oh ſaith one, if I had lived in the Jewes time, I would never have oppoſed Chriſt and his Apoſtles, I would have kiſſed the very ground that they trod on; then, wretch why doeſt thou not doe that which theſe men preached? looke in the writings of theſe holy men, of <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. Doſt thou doe that which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> have wrote thou ſhouldeſt doe? doeſt thou look in their writings, and not obey what they have wrote? I tell thee, if <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were alive, they would tell thee thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be damned, if thou repenteſt not. if <hi>John</hi> and <hi>James</hi> were alive, they would tell thee that the wrath of God will take hold on thee, if thou yeeld not obedience to that word they preached to thee.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> were alive, he ſhould have many a <hi>Tertullus</hi> to oppoſe him: if <hi>John</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, he ſhould have many a <hi>Herod</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon him: if <hi>Amos</hi> were alive, he ſhould have many an <hi>Amaziah</hi> to baniſh him, and to ſilence him; but now they are dead, men can like them well enough.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>righteous man</hi> in the way, <hi>is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

                     </gap>s an abomination to the wicked: for when he is dead, they may praiſe him, and love him, and love to have his picture amongſt them: then they will ſpeake well of him, and commend him. I ſpeake <hi>that,</hi> becauſe I would not be miſconſtrued.</p>
                  <p>Let a man be a godly man indeed, a Saint indeed, as long as he lives, the men of the world will hate him. <hi>I have choſen you out of the world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and therefore the world hates you, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath beene an old haunt and cuſtome of the world to hate and maligne the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to reproach them, to call them Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, &amp;c: though very heathens have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that there is no religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out purity. <hi>Cicero, Horace</hi> and others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a man that is religious, ſay that he is an <hi>intire man, a man pure from ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any man will not beleeve it, let him trie it: let him be holy and gratious, and ſhew forth the power of religion in his life, let him contemne the world, &amp;c. and ſee whether wicked men will not hate him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and diſgrace him what they can: not as if a godly man could not be godly and religious, unleſſe he be hated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:121624:92"/> by the world: for it may be.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when a man that is truly religious and godly is a <hi>great man,</hi> and all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are loth to loſe his favour, or to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe his ili will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he may be free from hate and reproach.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when he is a <hi>man of admirable witte and knowledge,</hi> that the world admires him for his learning, and for his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and for his parts: ſuch a one men will rather <hi>admire</hi> then revile.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it may ſo be that <hi>God may give a godly man favour in the eyes of the world:</hi> howſoever the world would hate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them, yet God may ſo ſtrike their conſciences that they cannot doe it.

                  <p>Laſtly, I put it <hi>in oppoſition to now and then preaching:</hi> a wicked man loves prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, though never ſo ſharpe and terrible, ſo it come but now and then: if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preach never ſo powerfully, never ſo terribly, if it give him <hi>a reproofe and away:</hi> ſo it doth not ſtand digging in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and galling his heart day by day;

                  <p>Laſtly, as it is an actuall affection of the heart, whereby the heart riſeth up againſt an union: ſo in the laſt place, it is againſt that that is diſſonant and repugnant to his luſt. For, as <hi>love is the conſonancy of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to a thing that hath agreement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:</hi> ſo hatred muſt needs be diſſonancy of affection to a thing that is repugnant and contrary to it. So, a wicked man he hates the word, becauſe it diſagrees and jarres with his luſt. Indeed a wicked man may love the word ſo long as it oppoſeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his luſt. Therefore a wicked man may love three kinds of preaching.</p>

                  <p>The vileſt drunkard, and blaſphemer, and ſwearer that is, will be content to heare of calling upon the Lord Jeſus at his death: the vileſt whoremaſter, and prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the earthly worldling, &amp;c. will yeeld to <hi>ſome</hi> preaching, and to ſome hearing, and to ſome reading: why, otherwiſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences would not be at quiet, but would be as the divells band-dogge, bawling and houting at him.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:121624:103"/> that any man reaſons ſo in words, I will doe thus and thus and undoe my ſelfe, I will ſteale and be hanged, I will be a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious childe and be diſinherited, I will goe on in my ſinnes, let the world ſay what it will, and be damned. But, when a man knowes that the wages of ſinne is death, that the end of drunkenneſſe, of ſwearing, of lying, of pride, ſecurity, hypocriſie, formality in religion &amp;c. is death; When a man knowes that the end of that ſinne which he lives in is <hi>damnation,</hi> and yet will goe on in thoſe ſinnes, he <hi>wills</hi> to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Ezek. 18. 31. Turne you, turne you, why will you dye O ye houſe of Iſrael?</hi> why? were any ſo madde as to be willing to dye, to periſh for ever? yet ſayth the Prophet, why will you dye, as if he ſhould ſay why will you ſinne? that man that wills to ſin, he wills to be damned; that man that will be damned rather then part with his ſinne, that man loves ſinne for ever, and ſo hates the light.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, be aſhamed to carry ſo many plague tokens upon your hearts, ſo many ſinnes in your ſoules, ſo many oppoſitions and rebellions againſt the word. That man that hates and rebells againſt the word, can never be ſaved by the word. You that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:121624:103"/> have had the preaching of the word, looke that you give way to it; take heed that you withſtand not the breath of it.</p>
                  <p>I could tell you one thing, and I pray God to ſend it home to your hearts: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly when God ſends his word to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, thoſe that are wrought upon, for the moſt part are wrought upon at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: generally it is ſo, I will give you a convincing place for it: <hi>Acts. 13. 48. And when the Gentiles heard this, they glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternall life, beleeved. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were come to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and had preached one Sabboth day, and now had preached another: <hi>The Gentiles glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternall life, beleeved;</hi> as if he had ſaid, all that were ordained to eternall life, beleeved at thoſe Sermons; as if he ſhould ſay againe, all that beleeved not at theſe two Sermons, were reprobates.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that did belong to God, they did beleeve, and hearkened to the preaching of the word to them, on thoſe two Sabboths; <hi>All that were ordained to life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they beleeved at</hi> theſe two Sermons: the reſt that beleeved not, are branded and marked out for deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and wonderers, <hi>Heare O deſpiſers, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:121624:104"/> wonder and periſh, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agree with thine Adverſary, whileſt thou art in the way. Math.</hi> 5. Beloved, you are now in the way of ſalvation: your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is the Lord himſelfe, till he be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto you; you are in the way while you are under the preaching of the word: you know not how ſoone God may take you out of the way: you know not how ſoone God may take his word away: or, if that continue, yet he may withdraw his <hi>Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and then, if God once take away his Spirit, then you may ſeeke to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but ſhall never finde it; you may ſeeke for grace, but ſhall never get it: you may ſeeke for Chriſt, but never obtaine him; if men ſtand out againſt the Word and Spirit of Chriſt, while it is beating upon their hearts, and offering them grace, then Chriſt will be <hi>a ſwift witneſſe againſt them. Malach.</hi> 3. 5. Doth Chriſt come to thee? <hi>now</hi> obey, <hi>now</hi> beleeve, <hi>now</hi> give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy ſinnes. Doth he bid thee now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? &amp;c. O give way to the Words of Chriſt, give way to the Spirit of Chriſt; otherwiſe, Chriſt will come ſwiftly: I will be a ſwift witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>I tell you, the Covenant of grace will not ſtay long: God is about to put up his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:121624:104"/> wares. When no Cuſtomers come, the Merchant puts up his wares; ſo God will even cloſe up all his graces; then Preachers may preach, but none ſhall be converted: People may heare, but none ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: People may heare, but never be turned; which the Lord deny from ever being amongſt us; therefore, <hi>while it is called to day, hearken, and the Feare of God be with you.</hi>

                  <p>Now by Gods permiſſion I will open theſe words in order unto you. And for the firſt, the <hi>Author</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>It is laid downe by queſtion and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>Queſtion, <hi>Who gave Jacob to the ſpoyle, and Iſrael to the robbers?</hi>

                     </gap>ais, who gave this people of mine to the enemies? did not I the Lord? therefore God he is the Author of all puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Cauſe</hi> why the Lord did
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:121624:106"/> this: for, ſome might ſay, why did the Lord overthrow <hi>this</hi> people, whom he did ſo tenderly reſpect for his, which were as the apple of his eye, and the ſtrength of his right arme? becauſe they ſinned againſt the Lord, and would not walke in his waies.</p>
                  <p>He ſets downe the <hi>Cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in <hi>generall,</hi> they have ſinned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in <hi>particular,</hi> they would not walke in his way, nor be obedient to his Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here is the <hi>Judgement it ſelfe,</hi> therefore hath he powred upon them the fierceneſſe of his anger, the ſtrength of the Battell and fire round about them. He calleth it the anger of <hi>the Lord:</hi> not of a King, or of a great man, but the <hi>anger of the Lord,</hi> the fury of his <hi>anger:</hi> ſhewing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of it he doth not ſay that God doth <hi>drop</hi> downe his anger; but, he <hi>poures</hi> out the fury of his indignation.

                     </hi> the Lord hath incloſed them in with indignation, ſo that they could ſee no way to get out of it, or to eſcape it. So then this ſhews the <hi>unavo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, who were theſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a <hi>praying</hi> and a <hi>profeſsing</hi> and a <hi>faſting</hi> people.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the <hi>effect</hi> of all this, how it did worke upon them. Yet, ſaith the Lord, they <hi>know</hi> it not, neither lay it to heart. Oh Lord, what monſtrous ſtupidity is this! though God did doe it; in his anger too; yet this poore Nation ſaw it not, neither regarded it, till the <hi>plague</hi> came; and when it came, they never laid it to heart, neither were they <hi>humbled</hi> by it, but did beare the plague, and <hi>afterwards</hi> went downe into hell, and never minded it.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo, beloved, ſtands the caſe with us; The Lord plagues us, and we ſee it not: his anger burnes round about us, and the fierceneſſe of his wrath ſuſtaineth to battell: and yet we perceive it not.</p>

And as God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth all things <hi>before</hi> they come; ſo he ordereth them and the <hi>time when</hi> they ſhall come; and they cannot come <hi>one</hi> moment of time before the Lord would have them. The <hi>Jewes</hi> could not lay hold on our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, becauſe <hi>his</hi> houre was not yet come. <hi>John.</hi> 8. 50. The wicked cannot pull downe puniſhments upon a Nation when they will; As its he <hi>ordaineth</hi> them: and the time <hi>when;</hi> ſo thirdly, he doth appoint them <hi>how long</hi> they ſhall lie upon men. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 10.

                  <p>Is God the orderer and diſpoſer of all? then this may comfort thy ſoul O thou poore childe of God; I ſay comfort thy ſoul with this, that the Lord is the temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all things, and the Phyſician that ſtands by and ſees how many <hi>drammes</hi> the Apothecary putteth in. The devill indeed may afflict thee, and wicked men may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thee; but thou ſhalt have no more then the Lord ſees good for thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though thine enemies take thee and kill thee, and <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> raile on thee, and <hi>Bonner</hi> burne thee, yet the Lord is a ſweete loving Father, and ordereth all things, and cannot finde in his heart to hurt thee. Though they be the Inſtruments, yet God he is the Author, and hath appointed <hi>how long</hi> and <hi>how much</hi> and <hi>for what</hi> they ſhall afflict thee. Therefore though the ſword finde thee, and faggot come: yea though thou beeſt baniſhed or ſawne aſunder, yet the Lord ordereth all things: and though he correct thee, yet he cannot finde in his heart to hurt thee.

When God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth his <hi>children,</hi> it is in mercie: but to the wicked his wrath is puniſhments, and his Judgements is anger and great wrath: and therefore when he puniſheth thee, thou mayeſt ſay a juſt Judge brandeth me in the hand.</p>

If you would doe theſe things, then there might be ſomething done: and if reproofe and admoniſhment will not ſerve the turne, then expell them and baniſh them, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſmael.</hi> You Chriſtians, mourne for your ſinnes, and joyne your hearts and prayers againſt the ſinnes of the place where you live.</p>
                  <p>If any houſe be on fire, others will come with water to quench it as if it were their owne: ſo here is a flame of fire kindled in this Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and the wrath of God is like wild fire comming downe upon us from heaven: therefore let every one of us bring ſome water or other to quench this fire that is round about us in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place, and almoſt upon all hearts.</p>
                  <p>Let every man ſweepe his owne doore, and the ſtreetes will be cleane; ſo if every one would purge his owne heart, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation would there be in every place?

                  <p>I proteſt againſt every man that harbours ſinne in his owne houſe or ſoule, that he is a traytor to the Kingdome, whatſoever he be; if I knew the man, I would faſten mine eyes on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tell him, Oh thou vile <hi>Achan,</hi> doeſt thou harbour theſe ſinnes, and traytors, and keepe theſe ſinnes, and then crie out of the dangerouſneſſe of the times?</p>

                     <hi>Lord often times brings fearfull and unavoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able judgements and puniſhments, even upon his owne profeſsing people:</hi> even they that offer ſacrifice, and that pray, and call him Father, and faſt and pray: even upon <hi>theſe</hi> people, he doth often times bring theſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:121624:113"/> therefore will I puniſh you for all your iniquities.</p>
                  <p>See the whole currant of Gods word: did not the Lord puniſh the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in the time of their Judges? they had many ſore enemies, as <hi>Eglon</hi> and <hi>Siſera.</hi> The ten Tribes they ſinned, and were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into captivity: and theſe were <hi>Gods profeſsing people.</hi> And afterward the other two Tribes, <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamine,</hi> were carried away captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there they were ſeventy yeares.</p>
                  <p>Forty yeares after Chriſt, the <hi>Romans</hi> came againſt them, and burnt all their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And theſe were <hi>Gods owne profeſsing people.</hi>

                  <p>The Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were famous Churches, but now they are overthrowne with <hi>Turkes.</hi> Now, our ſinnes give God juſt cauſe to make him come againſt us, with puniſhments and judgements upon this Land.</p>
                  <p>If a man lie ſicke, and they ſee death in his face, they call it the foretelling ſigne: ſo the Miniſters of God may foreſee the <hi>death</hi> and deſtruction of <hi>a</hi> Kingdome.

                  <p>The <hi>ſignes of Gods puniſhments that are comming upon us, are theſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is of Gods Miniſters which with one voice doe foretell judgements to come.</p>
                  <p>Then, this is a ſigne that God haſteneth to battell, <hi>Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Surely the Lord will doe nothing but he revealeth his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to his ſervants the Prophets: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>when they agree all in one thing;</hi> then the Kingdome is dangerouſly gone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>I will ſay nothing in this, but let me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to your owne conſciences, whether all good Miniſters in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have not declared by Gods word that judgements are comming out againſt this Land and us for many yeares together: And as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall binde on earth ſhall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, when ſinnes of all ſorts doe abound frequently, and with a bold face, and a whoriſh forehead. For when the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is ripe, then commeth ſo many ſickles to cut it downe: ſo when the ſinnes of a Kingdome are <hi>ripe,</hi> then it is time to cut

Conſider whether it be not thus with <hi>England</hi> or no. Was ever drunkenneſſe and blaſphemie, and ſcoffing at religion, and prophaning Gods Sabboths, nay liberty given ſo to do, was it ever come to that height that now it is? were ever great ones, as Biſhops and Miniſters, ſo defiled, as now they are? our Land hath often beene overcome: when men were growne <hi>deſperately</hi> wicked, then they were deſtroyed. Now, what ſinnes, what blaſphemies, what hating of God ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth raging in our times? I thinke there is none in this Congregation but ſees and heares, how Citie and Countrey are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed and benummed, and defiled with ſinnes of all ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when the devill and wicked men caſt bones of diſſention, that is a ſigne of ruine. When there was a diſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:121624:115"/> both againſt <hi>Judab,</hi> then it is a fearefull ſigne that that Nation ſhall be deſtroied.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, to apply this, if ever a Kingdome were divided, then this is; if we could all accord, then we might expect ſomething: but, now, our beſt bloud is gone, and our hearts are gone: the Lord in mercie raiſe us up from dead aſhes.</p>
                  <p>O conſider this, I beſeech you, and lay it to heart. Will God deceive his Miniſters, and make them all blindefold? no no. When God puts his Spirit into his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and makes them all with <hi>one</hi> mouth to call and crie deſolation, and when all manner of ſinnes ſo fearefully abound, and when there is ſuch diviſions in the State, then let us looke for deſolation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the fourth ſigne of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on a Nation is, when all the hearts of men <hi>faile</hi> then it is a ſigne that vengeance is at the doore; when there is a kinde of <hi>Cowardiſe through the guilt of the conſcience.

It was a certaine ſigne of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction when the peoples hearts <hi>failed</hi> them: thus it is with every man almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us: every mans heart is faint and ſicke. <hi>Judges</hi> 7. 13. When <hi>Gideon</hi> was to goe againſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> being a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Army, one dreamed that a cake of

Even ſo it is with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we faint upon every occaſion, Gods Spirit is gone from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While <hi>Sampſon</hi> had the Spirit of God upon him, he was too hard for the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins:</hi> but when the Spirit of God was gone from him, he had no heart, no ſpirit, no courage; then every man was too hard for him, and then he was taken, and had his eyes pulled out. So when the Spirit of God was with <hi>this</hi> Nation, we had courage and got the day; but now alas, every ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Nation is too hard for us, and every bug<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beare ſcares us. O poore <hi>England,</hi> heavy is thy caſe, therefore we may expect nothing but miſerie one way or another.</p>

I am not a Prophet, nor the ſonne of a Prophet: but from the word of the Lord I ſpeake this thing unto you, and upon theſe grounds I can ſay ſo; That where theſe ſignes are, deſtruction and calamities follow at the heeles of them.

O therefore caſt them quite out of thy heart. I would to God I could bring my heart and yours to this pitch, that we could give wiſe and children and all as loſt. I confeſſe it is hard ſo to doe: but God will <hi>ſire</hi> us out <hi>ſhortly</hi> from theſe things, if we <hi>part</hi> not from them, in theſe our deepeſt afflictions. <hi>Jer. 45. 5.

But, alas, poore ſoules, many of you are ſo bound in the chaines of your ſinnes, that you cannot finde any leiſure to pray; you ſave your prayers and teares till you come to hell, and then they will doe you no good; Oh, thy Mother lies a dying, and wilt thou not mourne for her? O dead and drie hearted wretches, me thinkes the poore Church of <hi>England</hi> is like the ſhippe of <hi>Jonas,</hi> and he faſt aſleepe in it; the Goſpell and all are drawing into a ſea of troubles: and thou poore wretch art aſleepe and canſt not pray. The Church is like a ſicke man upon his bed: and the Parliament is like a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge full of Phyſicians, they caſt the State of the Kingdome, and then give it over for loſt. The Lord knowes how ſoone the bell may <hi>ring out;</hi> and yet thou canſt not pray nor weepe. Ah, the Lord be mercifull to the hardneſſe of our hearts. Haſt thou but one teare in thine eyes? but one prayer in thy heart? then ſpend them now for the poore Church of God. Make all ſound within, and get ſound faith in the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, that may ſupport<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hold you up as the Arke did <hi>Noah</hi> in the floud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my deare people of this Pariſh, a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:121624:118"/> floud is come upon this Land: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make you an Arke of Gopher, and pitch it within and without: get in it, hang not about it; but, get into your Lord Chriſt, and ſhut up your ſelves in him, as <hi>Noah</hi> did in the Arke, and never come out. This is your ſafegard, if you be in <hi>him,</hi> you ſhall be ſupported againſt all troubles, and ſo ſhall the caſe goe well with you. For as the Prophet ſaid to <hi>Ahab,</hi> high thee hence, for here is a ſound of much raine: and there came a ſhower indeed. So ſay I, high you away to Chriſt: for it may be you ſhall not heare many Sermons more: there is a ſound of many puniſhments and ſtormes falling downe upon us. Oh thrice happy are we that have got Chriſt upon good termes and good grounds: if a <hi>floud</hi> come, it doth me good to ſee how ſafe I am: for the higher troubles ariſe, the higher the Arke will ariſe, and the higher your faith and comfort will ariſe, and you ſhall ſit like <hi>Noah</hi> in the Cabin. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 20. Come my people and enter into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſhut the doores about thee, and hide your ſelves as it were for a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, untill the indignation be overpaſt.</p>
                  <p>What? would <hi>Noah</hi> have beene hired to come out of the Arke? no by no meanes:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:121624:118"/> nothing would have got him out. I may even pitty you my people, that have no Faith. What will you doe and whether will you flie? all you that have not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the Arke, and have not made ſure worke, if the flood ſhould come to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, you muſt certainly be drowned. If you looke to God, he is your Enemy; if you looke within, there your Conſciences dogg you; and if thou lookeſt for comfort to the Miniſter, there is none for thee in all Gods word; if thou hang on a Miniſter, he muſt ſay as <hi>Samuell</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> ſince the Lord hath forſaken thee, I can doe thee no good. Oh thinke on this, and get all thy friends into the Arke with thee, as <hi>Noah</hi> did. Let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Would it not grieve thee when thou ſitteſt in the Arke, to ſee a poore husband or a child a drowning in the flood, and going to Hell? For the Lords ſake, o my deere Brethren, ſpare no paines to doe them good.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, get a more ſtrong Faith then ordinary; deep dangers muſt have a ſtronger Faith; a man cannot row upon the maine ocean in a paire of ſcullers; but
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:121624:119"/> hee muſt have a good ſhip well ballaced, and a good Pilot; ſo doe you thinke to rowe upon the maine ocean of Gods wrath in a paire of ſcullers? therefore labour to ſtrengthen your Faith, and to get a good ſhip well pitcht and ballaſted, and <hi>ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall</hi> Faith; for the winde will trie it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or not; a Summers dublet will not ſerve the turne in a Winters froſt; ſo a little ſtrength and comfort will not ſerve the turne in the ſtormes that are comming on us; but we muſt get winter garments; the Eaſt winde will trie a mans clothes. Though a weak Faith may carry thee to Heaven, yet not with ſo much comfort as a ſtronger; eſpecially if it be but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the downefall of the Pope; for <hi>then</hi> there will be the greateſt combuſtions that ever was or ever ſhall be; and by all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, the time is <hi>now at hand.</hi> Then, thy Faith had need to bee greater then ever it was. As the Angell ſaid to the Prophet, up and eat, for thou haſt a great journey to goe; ſo ſay I to thee, thou fainting ſoule, make a good meale of Faith, ſtrengthen thy Faith upon the promiſes, for thou haſt a great worke to doe, and happily thou mayſt goe ſix monethes, and not ſee the face of a good Miniſter, nor talke with a good Miniſter,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:121624:119"/> when there ſhall bee no more <hi>Rogens, Hookers, Beadles</hi> and <hi>Cottons</hi> to talk with; and you ſhall wander about in the woods; your faith to ſupport you <hi>then,</hi> it will doe you ſome good.

What need haſt thou of ſtrong Faith, when thou muſt fight againſt halfe a ſcore Papiſts and an Army of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a world of Divells from Hell? then thou haſt need of a ſtronger Faith then ordinarie.

                     <p>For the <hi>Coherence;</hi> the Spirit of God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving exhorted the Believers how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Faith, and with patience to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe thoſe tryalls which accompany the

                     <p>The Holy Ghoſt diſcovers it two wayes. Firſt, by a generall deſcription in the three firſt verſes; and after by the worthy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the faithfull in the Church of old.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the <hi>generall</hi> deſcription of Faith in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the firſt verſe, <hi>Faith is the ground of things &amp;c.</hi> Faith makes things hoped for ſubſiſt to a Beleever.</p>

                     <p>But before I come to the maine, we will note ſomething in generall.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:121624:127"/> And have not the Saints of God found it ſo? what a hard conceit had the <hi>Jewes</hi> of Chriſt? <hi>He is not worthy to live.</hi> So of <hi>Paul, Acts 22. They were accounted the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of the world, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 13. And as it was in the Apoſtles times, ſo it is now; and would you know the reaſon?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe God hath <hi>choſen</hi> them out <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> of the world. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 19.

                     <p>3. Becauſe wicked men <hi>meaſure others</hi>

                     <p>But before I handle this point, I will give the ſence and meaning of the words.</p>
                     <p>This word <hi>World</hi> is diverſly taken. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken for the <hi>whole Fabrick of Heaven and earth, John</hi> 1. 10. He was in the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> was made by him, and the <hi>world</hi> knew him not. So <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 24. God that made the <hi>world, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes it is taken <hi>for all mankinde,</hi> good and bad. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. As by one man ſin entred into the <hi>world (viz.</hi>) ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the men which are in the world.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it is taken for <hi>the elect onely;</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. Behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſinne of <hi>the world, (viz,</hi>) the elect in the world. Againe, God ſo loved the <hi>world, &amp;c. John 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. (viz.</hi>) his elect in the world. Againe, we beleeve this is the Saviour of the <hi>world, John 4. 42. (viz.</hi>) of the elect in the world.</p>
                     <p>But why are the godly called the <hi>world?</hi> 
                        <label type="milestone">

                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, firſt becauſe the world was <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                        </label> made for <hi>them,</hi> and it is continued yet for their ſakes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they may be called the world becauſe they are <hi>ſcattered through the world,</hi>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:121624:128"/> and that not onely among the <hi>Iewes</hi> but even among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly they may be called the world, becauſe in themſelves they are <hi>a world</hi> of people; but yet compare them with the Devills drove, they are <hi>few,</hi> even as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Olive tree, <hi>Eſay</hi> 17. 6. yet in themſelves they are as the Starres in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5. And <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaid, who can number the duſt of <hi>Iacob? Numb.</hi> 22. 10.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it is taken for the <hi>reprobates in the world.</hi> ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 19. If you were of the world, the <hi>world</hi> would love its owne. It is plaine alſo in the prayer of Chriſt; I pray not for the <hi>world. Iohn</hi> 17. 9. And they may fitly be called the <hi>world;</hi> Firſt, becauſe they are the <hi>worlds</hi> Citizens, they mind the things of the world, they follow nothing but the world. Secondly, becauſe they are the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of the world.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the world is taken for the <hi>things in the world,</hi> thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll uſes to draw men from God; as the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eyes, the pride of life. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 16. Sometimes for the happy eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the godly ſhall enjoy after this life. So <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 35. They which ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:121624:129"/> worthy to obtaine <hi>that world &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>of whom the world was not worthy;</hi> I take it he means wicked men in the world, and thoſe are they that are not <hi>worthy</hi> the company of the godly. And becauſe I intend to ſhew the unworthineſſe of the world, I will ſhew firſt that the things in this world are little worth. Secondly that the <hi>men</hi> in the world are little worth.</p>
                     <p>Firſt I will ſhew you, that <hi>the things in</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                        <hi>the world are little worth;</hi> as Riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, pleaſures &amp;c. they are called <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> riches; and Chriſt calls them the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of iniquitity. Luke 16. 9. traſh. Luke 8. 14. Snares. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 9. They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>uncertaine riches.</hi> Now theſe baſe titles muſt needs argue that they are <hi>little worth;</hi> for were they worth more, God would ſet better titles on them. And <hi>Salomon</hi> who had beſt experience of them, yet he termes them vanitie. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 2. and 11.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are little worth, becauſe they are very <hi>unprofitable;</hi> they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit a man; It is plaine by the ſpeech of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel. 1 Sam.</hi> 12. 21. Vaine things which cannot profit <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they are little worth, becauſe <hi>they cannot further a man in the maine thing</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:121624:129"/> at which he ſhould ayme; they may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man in ſome trifles, but not in the maine thing. There is no true good comes to a man by all the riches in the world; neither can they free a man from the evill day; neither can they make you better ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>reſpect of God or your ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, in <hi>reſpect of God,</hi> they cannot make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> you better eſteemed with God: for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not the rich more then the poore. <hi>Iob.</hi> 34. 19. He doth not account of a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>greatnes,</hi> but according to his <hi>goodneſſe. Prov.</hi> 20. 7, 8. Better is a poore man that walks in his integritie, then a King that is perverſe in his wayes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they cannot better him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of God, becauſe they cannot aſſure him of the <hi>love</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they cannot make a man more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                        <hi>mindfull</hi> of God; nay they corrupt mens hearts, they make a man more forgetfull of God. It is thus with the greateſt part of men in the world that are worldly rich; it is with them as it was with the <hi>Prodigall,</hi> who while he had money in his purſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did he thinke on his Father.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the things of this world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> make a man more <hi>thankfull</hi> to God, but rather the contrary, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, in <hi>reſpect of our ſelves;</hi> Firſt, all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the things of this life cannot in rich a mans ſoule with <hi>grace;</hi> they cannot make him humble, nor mercifull, nor conſtant in the profeſſion of godlineſſe and good duties; nay it rather makes them the more unmeet to any goodneſſe; where there is <hi>gaine</hi> in the cheſt, there is <hi>loſſe</hi> in the Conſcience; he that gets money apace, may loſe Faith and a good Conſcience; and they that moſt covet for abundance of the things of this life, are moſt backward in Grace; and this argues that the things of <hi>this</hi> life are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth, even in reſpect of a mans ſelfe.</p>

The ſloughfull man (<hi>viz.</hi>) the worldly man, roſteth not that which he tooke in hunting, (<hi>viz.</hi>) after all his travaile he is ſwept away, and taketh not the profit of them.

                     <p>Now you ſhall ſee that <hi>wordly men are little worth:</hi> Firſt, it appeares that they are little worth, becauſe of the <hi>names and titles</hi> that the Spirit of God laies on them; it calls them <hi>Sonnes of Beliall. 1 Sam. 2. 12.

Now if there were any great worth in them, thinke you that the Spirit of God would not better ſtile them?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are little worth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their actions; their <hi>beſt</hi> actions are but <hi>glittering ſinnes. Eſay</hi> 66. 3. If they pray, or heare <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God accounts of

                     <p>If then the men of the world be little <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Secondly, let this informe our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that ſeeing the world, and the men of the world are ſo little worth; let us judge of them no better then they deſerve; it is a <hi>falſe</hi> glaſſe, or <hi>crooked</hi> rule that men goe by, who judge themſelves men of worth if they be rich, and we uſe to ſay there is a man of good credit; let us ſee our folly in thus judging.

                     <p>The things of the world are given to the worſt men; wicked men have many times the <hi>greateſt</hi> ſhare in them. <hi>Eſau</hi> hath foure

                        <hi>was a great price paid for them;</hi> it adds much to the worth of a thing when there is a <hi>great</hi> price paide for it; ſo this adds to the worth of all <hi>true</hi> beleevers that the price was <hi>great</hi> that was paid for them; <hi>they were not bought with corruptible things;</hi> not with two hundred fore-ſkinnes of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> bought <hi>Michal;</hi> nor with thirtie change of raiment, the reward of thoſe that unfolded <hi>Samſons</hi> Riddle; they were not bought with a great ſumme of Money, as the <hi>Romane</hi> Burgeſſeſhip was; I ſay not with corruptible things, <hi>but with the precious bloud of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for in

                     <p>Thirdly, they are worthy in <hi>reſpect of the Conſciences of the wicked;</hi> for it is for their worth, that they beare them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; it is <hi>goodneſſe</hi> that is perſecuted in good men.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>the meritorious deſerving Cauſe,</hi> wherein God gives an account what he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:121624:139"/> doth, how inexcuſable the world is, and how juſt God is unto the 14. <hi>verſ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>a Direction unto Noah to make an Arke,</hi> where we may ſee that God in his judgement remembers mercy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>meritorious deſerving cauſe,</hi> is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, from the <hi>quantity</hi> of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in thoſe evill daies; <hi>a great many; verſ.</hi> the firſt, men began to multiply in places populous; where there are <hi>ſome</hi> good, there are <hi>many</hi> bad.</p>
                  <p>Secondly by the <hi>quality</hi> of thoſe perſons; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> when they ſaw the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men: the ſonnes of God (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>poſterity of them that maintained Religion,</hi> they began to be careleſſe and <hi>carnally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,</hi> they did looke after the profits and pleaſures of this life, and then it was high time for God to enter into Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by the kind of ſinne; <hi>They luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

                     <hi>after unlawfull Marriages &amp;c.</hi> and the root of this was originall corruption; the <hi>Imaginations of mans heart, was onely evill and that continually.</hi> verſe 5.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words, are a <hi>Proclamation of Gods purpoſe,</hi> to bring it to an end; in which are foure things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>the Lords complaint</hi> in theſe words, <hi>the Lord ſaid.</hi>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:121624:139"/>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>the Proclamation it ſelfe</hi> in theſe words, <hi>my Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>the reaſon,</hi> becauſe he is but fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the <hi>limitation of the time,</hi> a hundred and twentie yeares, in which time if they repent, I will repent; but if they will not, <hi>my Spirit ſhall not alway ſtrive.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, I have tried <hi>all</hi> concluſions and uſed all meanes, partly by <hi>Mercies</hi> to allure them, partly by <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to terrifie them; partly by my <hi>word</hi> to recall them, and by all meanes poſſible to bring them to my ſelfe; yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine incorrigible; I now am reſolved to ſtrive with them no more.</p>
                  <p>From the words thus opened there will naturally ariſe theſe two points.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>there is a</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>time when God will ſtrive with men no more, and that in this life;</hi> The ſcope of this aimes at the whole world; but what is ſaid in <hi>generall,</hi> may alſo be ſaid in <hi>particular.</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:121624:140"/> well then, there is a time <hi>in this life,</hi> and not when we are <hi>dead</hi> and gone; for <hi>then</hi> it is certaine there is no more comming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; but, in <hi>this</hi> life there is a time when God will ſtrive with men no more, neither for their good <hi>here,</hi> nor for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting happineſſe <hi>hereafter.</hi> For, unto every <hi>thing</hi> there is an appointed time. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 3. 1. Now the Lord calls lovingly to <hi>allure</hi> us; but there will come a time of <hi>goe yee curſed;</hi> the good Spirit of mine which thou haſt abuſed, ſhall never come to thee more; this is a marvailous <hi>trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</hi> truth: yet moſt true; for men now will have their wills, and God muſt be at <hi>their</hi> leiſure, and come (forſooth) when they pleaſe. They will live as they liſt, doe as they liſt, and God muſt ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on them as they liſt, and when they liſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So there is a time when God will <hi>ſtrive;</hi> but when <hi>that</hi> time is gone, God will will ſtrive <hi>no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make this plaine I will lay downe theſe ſix things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will let you ſee that it hath been ſo, by Teſtimonies of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will ſhew in or after what manner God deales with a ſoule in giving it over.</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:121624:140"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, I will ſhew who they be that God gives over.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I will ſhew the grounds of it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the objections againſt it.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, we will come to the uſes.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt; Teſtimonies of <hi>Scripture,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> you beleeve them, and you doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the things delivered there are certaine; ſee it in <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe thou haſt <hi>rejected</hi> the word of the Lord, the Lord hath alſo rejected thee from being King <hi>&amp;c. 1 Sam.</hi> 15. 23. The Lord had <hi>ſtriven</hi> with <hi>Saul many</hi> wayes; by giving him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Honour, in making him King; he had given him <hi>gifts of the Spirit,</hi> he was not wanting unto him in any meanes; yet he not regarding all this, but <hi>neglecting</hi> that which his Conſcience told him ſhould be done hereupon the Lord tooke away; that <hi>good</hi> Spirit from <hi>Saul,</hi> and gave him an <hi>evill</hi> Spirit, as himſelfe confeſſed to the Witch of <hi>Endor.</hi> And as ſome Divines underſtand that ſaying of <hi>David, Pſal. 51. 11. Caſt me not out of thy ſight or preſence,</hi> is not to be underſtood of <hi>Government,</hi> but of the <hi>Church</hi> of God; Caſt me not out of thy preſence as thou didſt my Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor <hi>Saul; Ergo,</hi> it is evident that <hi>Saul</hi> was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:121624:141"/> given over even in this life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that of the <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16, 17, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 18. ſaith the Text, <hi>Let there not be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon among you as Eſau;</hi> marke that man is a <hi>prophane</hi> man, that for one morſell of profit or pleaſure, will caſt off the favour of the <hi>living</hi> God; let there not be any ſuch among you (ſaith the Text.) The Apoſtle meanes not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inheritance onely, but that which is of the Son-ſhip of God, which the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right then was.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 41, 42. where our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Saviour weepes over <hi>Jeruſalem, Oh Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem &amp;c.</hi> oh <hi>that thou hadſt knowne in this thy day of viſitation! &amp;c.</hi> but <hi>now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> Why? becauſe thou didſt not know <hi>thy</hi> time; God viſits us from day to day, either in <hi>Mercies,</hi> or <hi>Iudgements;</hi> in mercy when he performes that which he hath promiſed; In Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when he brings on men thoſe Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which formerly he denounced; So our Saviour tells them they had a <hi>day,</hi> oh that thou hadſt knowne in this <hi>thy day! &amp;c.</hi> But now they are hid from thine eyes, and thou ſhalt ſee them no more: thus you ſee it is plainly proved by evidence of Scripture.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:121624:141"/>
                  <p>Secondly, I will ſhew you how the Lord deals with ſuch <hi>rebellious</hi> &amp; ſtubborn crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures who after the Lord hath tried al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions on them, yet cannot bring them to amendment, but that ſtill they will goe on in their ſins, then the Lord changeth his minde, and he <hi>repents</hi> him of the good he hath done unto them. And ſo he repented that he had made <hi>Saul</hi> King.</p>
                  <p>But how can God <hi>repent?</hi>

                  <p>I anſwer, there may be a change of the <label type="milestone">

                     </label> 
                     <hi>thing,</hi> though not of the <hi>perſon.</hi> The Lord repents that ever he ſet a Miniſter over a ſoule to convert it, if it deſpiſe his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: though <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, yet my mind could not be tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard them: The Lord then had a minde; he loved the young man in the Goſpell, that is he kindly invited him, but yet ſaith the text, <hi>he went away ſorrowfull,</hi> he would not ſell <hi>all</hi> to follow Chriſt: ſo the Lord of heaven and earth ſtrives with men, he hath a good minde to winne them, he ſends his Miniſters to them, and when will it be that <hi>that uncleane</hi> luſt of thine will be reformed: The Lord calls the firſt, ſecond and third time, and when he ſees it will not prevaile, at laſt he gives thee over. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord gives over that man to the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:121624:142"/> 
                     <hi>power</hi> of that ſinne which he never did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he ſtrove with him; we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe our ſinnes or our ſoules: and <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> if no meanes will ſerve to bring a man home, then the Lord gives him over to commit his <hi>old</hi> ſinne; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 11. 12. the Lord tells there what he had done for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how he had brought them out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:</hi> but <hi>my people</hi> ſaith he <hi>would not heare: Iſrael</hi> would none of me, none of my holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, none of my pureneſſe, none of my waies; but their owne waies, wills and witts were beſt: <hi>ergo</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I gave them up to their owne hearts luſt.</hi> He doth not ſay he gave them up unto the <hi>Syrians</hi> to plague them, nor to the enemies of the Church to ride upon them; but to <hi>their owne luſts.</hi> The inceſtuous perſon received good by his excommunication: but when a man is <hi>given over</hi> unto rebellion, it is hard for him to be recalled backe; it had beene better for that man if he had never beene borne. For as the skinne of a Rabit comes well off till it comes to the head, and then there is haling and pulling; ſo a man can crucifie <hi>many</hi> luſts, and performe many good duties; but when once he is come to the head, to his <hi>dareling</hi> ſinne, to his <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>the Lord hardens that man:</hi> he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> repents of the good that is done unto him,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:121624:143"/> he gives him up to the power of his luſts: and blaſts all his parts, ſo that he hardens up his heart; and looke by what meanes God ſought to bring him unto him, <hi>thoſe</hi> meanes harden him; afflictions harden him, which ſhould have beene the meanes to have recalled him. God braies a foole ten times in a morter, and yet he is the harder, harder and harder. Men live in the <hi>Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine</hi> of the Goſpell, yet many are harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. Thoſe that have profeſſed the Goſpell, forſake their <hi>firſt-love,</hi> and are become like the Smiths dogge that lies at the Anvill and ſleepes though the ſparkles flie about his eares: ſo let the ſonnes of thunder ſay what they will, yet it ſhall not trouble them.</p>

                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:121624:143"/> comes with a <hi>diſcerning</hi> ſpirit, and tells them that <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>luſt</hi> cannot ſtand together; yet they would faine be ſaved. See <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 16. the young prodigall would faine have filled his bellie with the husks: the meaning is, every unregenerate man having lived after his owne luſts, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being mette withall and terrified with Gods wrath, he would leave his ſin, <hi>yet he would faine fill his belly with the husks,</hi> (viz.) with his luſts: he intends to be drunk no more, to be prophane no more, to be looſe no more: but now he will <hi>faſt</hi> it out, <hi>pray</hi> it out: and yet ſaith the text he would faine fill his bellie. There is never a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> man but he would faine reſt upon <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what;</hi> but where the Lord hath a minde to bring a man home, he will not let him reſt upon outward performances. One ſaith he hath beene counted a <hi>profeſſour</hi> theſe twenty yeares, and <hi>ergo</hi> he ſaies his caſe is good. Another ſaies he <hi>prayes in his family,</hi> and doth many good duties: another ſaith <hi>God hath bleſſed him divers wayes,</hi> and <hi>ergo</hi> his caſe is good: but thoſe the Lord pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to doe good unto, he will not ſuffer them thus to deceive themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and laſtly, <hi>The Lord gives a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion to all meanes for merly uſed that they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:121624:144"/> ſhall never come to him more:</hi> the Lord bids thoſe judgements and mercies wherewith he ſought to humble him before, never more to meddle with him. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Idols, let him alone, <hi>Hoſ. 4. 17. viz.</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> and his ſinnes are joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. 6. God ſpeakes of his <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> ſaying, what could be done more? yet becauſe it brought forth <hi>wilde grapes,</hi> when I looked it ſhould bring forth good, <hi>ergo</hi> ſaith the Lord, I will lay it waſt, I will take away my former protection, and I will command the cloudes that they raine no more upon it. <hi>viz. The meanes of grace and ſalvation ſhall be offered no more unto it.</hi> I will heare ſuch a man no more, I wil take away my Miniſters from him. You know that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> would have gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aſia,</hi> but the Spirit ſuffered them not: this is a hard condition when the Spirit will not ſuffer good to be done unto a man, a Citie or a Nation. And thus much for the teſtimonie of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>I will let you ſee what perſons</hi>

As if one ſhould

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe that have much calling</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>and meanes, and alſo many ſecret workings of the Spirit on them,</hi> that when they have gon out of the Houſe of God, have determined never to be drunke more, never to ſweare, lie, nor ſteale more &amp;c. and yet theſe come to nought. He that hath had many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 13. Becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I tried thy wayes what might do thee good, and thou ſeemedſt to be good, but thou waſt not good in earneſt, <hi>ergo</hi> thou ſhalt not be purged. Such a man who hath lived under the Goſpell, and hath had his heart ſhaken, yea and the world hath good hopes of him, but the devil ſees it &amp; tempts him, ſo that on the ſudden this man wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders away, and his hopes are vain. <hi>Heb. 10.

He ſpeakes of holding out in a Chriſtian courſe unto the end: looke how it was with <hi>Lots</hi> wife. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. ſhe looked backe, as if ſhe were loth to goe from that pleaſant garden, fine hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſuch and ſuch gold in ſuch a corner;

Now if he dealt ſo with her, how will he deale with thee and others? ſome it may be have a good minde to come home: but what ſay they, ſhall we leave all our pleaſures and profits? will not a little profeſſion of Religion and a great deale of the world goe together for currant? Take heede, the Lord may juſtly turne thee into ſalt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thoſe that have much greived <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the good Spirit of God, in bringing in ſome ſinne contrary to the <hi>light</hi> of conſcience, and the ſuggeſtions of the good Spirit of God, as did the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the good Spirit of God, and <hi>ergo</hi> he ſware &amp;c. The Miniſter bids thee cut off thy long haire, and the word ſaies it is a ſhame for a man to weare long haire: yet for all this ſaieſt thou, I will not: what will the world ſay of me then? away with theſe faſhions, leave off cards and dice &amp;c. ſaies the Spirit of God, and whatſoever is of evill report: yea but I will not, for what will Sir <hi>John</hi> and my Lady ſay then?

                  <p>Fourthly, Such as have a common, baſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> vile and <hi>contemptible</hi> eſteeme of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell and Miniſters thereof. <hi>They mocked the Miniſters till the wrath of God broke out againſt them, and there was no remedy. 2 Chron.</hi> 36. 16. A Miniſter cannot be plaine but wicked men will abuſe him in their hearts. I called and cried ſaith wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but you ſet at nought all my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24, 25. and going away they make a tuſh at it. I, ſaith one, Maſter Miniſter, you mette with mens hearts to day, but I beleeve yours is as bad as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, elſe how could you have hitte them ſo right? ſee what the Spirit of God ſaith of ſuch <hi>Eſay</hi> 22. 21. In <hi>that day</hi> did the Lord call to weeping &amp;c. the text told them of a judgement, and nothing to be expected but miſerie: but they make a tuſh of it, and ſay, come, we ſhall all die, <hi>ergo</hi> let us eate and drinke and be merrie while we may; the Miniſter tells us we ſhall all to hell, then let us have the other
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:121624:146"/> pot and the other pipe, if it muſt needs be ſo. Oh my beloved, can the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven indure to be thus diſgraced in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell and Miniſters? Another ſaies, care I what the Miniſter ſaith? I will goe and drinke at every Ale-houſe, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe judgements will come or no.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to the fourth thing, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is the <hi>grounds of it, (viz.</hi>) Why the Lord in this life doth give men over, and ſtrive with them no more. This truth is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and curſed hearts cannot abide it.</p>
                  <p>The grounds of this point ariſe from theſe two Attributes of God, his juſtice and his wiſedome.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the <hi>juſtice of God:</hi> God is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> juſt God; and is it not juſt that thoſe who have rejected him, that he ſhould reject them? I have called, but you anſwered not. <hi>Jer. 7. 13. ergo</hi> &amp;c. Now as it is juſt with God to fulfill every word that he hath ſpoken, and to fulfill <hi>all his promiſes</hi> to the faithfull, ſo is it juſt with God to bring <hi>judgment</hi> on them that have ſlighted him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the <hi>wiſedome</hi> of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and his <hi>long ſuffering;</hi> and this is becauſe his compaſſions faile not: elſe, the firſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:121624:147"/> day of our ſinning had beene the firſt day of our rejection: yea it is his <hi>goodneſſe</hi> that we have any favour; but Oh our God is a wiſe God. A man that knocks at the dore, if he be wiſe, will not alwaies lie knocking, if none anſwer: ſo the Lord knocks at our hearts by <hi>mercies</hi> to allure us, by <hi>judgements</hi> to terrifie us: yet he can finde no entrance. Is it not wiſedome then to be gone? <hi>Why ſhould I ſmite you any more,</hi> ſaith God? <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.</hi> 1. 5. As if he ſhould ſay tis to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for my life I know not what to doe with you: it is wiſedome to give over, when there is no good to be done on you: What could I have done more for my V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And doe you thinke that God will always be ſending <hi>Paul</hi> to plant, and <hi>Appollos</hi> to water? no, our God is a wiſe God, and our mercifull God is a juſt God: you that will have your wayes and wills, take them, and get you to hell &amp; periſh everlaſtingly.</p>

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:121624:149"/>
                  <p>Some are <hi>inſenſible</hi> and ſome <hi>ſenſible.</hi> The <hi>inſenſible</hi> are they who die like ſtones as did <hi>Nabal;</hi> We have many King <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proteſtants.</hi> Others are <hi>ſenſible,</hi> God hath opened the eye of their ſoules, and hath let them read the red letters of the Goſpell; It is a heavie thing for old friends to part, ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 38. They grieved moſt in that he ſaid you ſhall ſee <hi>my face</hi> no more; ſo when ſoule and bodie part, it is heavie; but when the ſoule <hi>and God</hi> part, it is lamentable; when God takes his leave never to be ſeene more, then whether thou looke upward or downeward, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but amazement, and aſtoniſhment. If thou looke upward, there is the anger of God; if downeward, there is the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit; if on the right hand, thou ſhall ſee all his mercies, which could not allure thee; if on the left hand, all his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which could not terrifie thee; if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, the black day; if behind thee, the Devills; this will be fearfull.</p>
                  <p>I remember a Storie of an adulterate woman, her Conſcience pricking her, ſhe determined to repent, but God in the meane time did viſit her ſo ſore that ſhe lay crying out, oh my time my time!</p>
                  <p>Another time, a covetous woman her

                  <p>So when the fire and indignation of the Lord breaks out, if not now, yet at the <hi>laſt</hi> day it will, then the parties againſt whom it breaks, will crie oh my ſoule, my ſoule, what will become of thee my ſoule? It had been better I had never been born; for neither Mercies, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the Word could allure mee; oh woe is me.</p>

Even ſo a mans ſinnes ſeeme to be <hi>dead,</hi> when the ſpirit of his luſt is conveighed into a higher luſt; as for example, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe here is one that is a <hi>covetous</hi> world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, this man peradventure is very <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> and <hi>temperate;</hi> he is not given to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, dicing, carding, wenching: he is not given to building or glorious apparell: but what are theſe ſinnes <hi>dead</hi> in him? no, but the ſtrength of them is carried up into a <hi>higher</hi> luſt: for if he ſhould follow whoring or gaming &amp;c. the luſt of his covetouſneſſe would be curbed, and his gaine would not come in with ſuch a full

It is not the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi> of theſe things, but the <hi>careleſſe</hi> practiſe of them in their lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; for although theſe ſinnes be in a ſwound, the ſtrength of them is gone up to maintaine a higher luſt; for ſuppoſe he went not to Church, how ſhould he maintaine his <hi>profeſsion?</hi> and if he could not <hi>now and then</hi> ſpeake of heaven, it were impoſſible he ſhould have his depth of <hi>ſelfe-deceipt;</hi> therefore we conclude theſe ſinnes are not <hi>mortified,</hi> they onely are <hi>civilized.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Sinne may be ſaid to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <hi>when it is overwharted by a higher principle:</hi> as when a man is ſenſible of the wrath of God, and hath the flaſhes of an accuſing conſcience flying daily into his face, lying under the guilt of many horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinnes, it is impoſſible for him to goe on with reſt and quietneſſe in thoſe his unholy courſes wherein he uſeth to walke; he may forſake them for <hi>a while,</hi> but yet he cannot <hi>mortifie</hi> them: but as a ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy that plaies the trewant, while he is under the rodde, he will confeſſe his fault, and promiſe to doe ſo no more, and he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thinketh ſo at that time, and deſires heartily ſo to doe: but it is a deſire that he is provoked unto for <hi>feare</hi> of the rodde, and not for <hi>love</hi> of dutie: for when once the rodde is gone, and the ſmart over, then he falls to his owne old trewanting cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againe.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:121624:157"/> ſo though ſinne be in you ſtill, yet let it be like a dead corpſe wanting life, like a dead Tyrant that can no longer rage: and hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Let not ſinne reigne in your mortall bodies:</hi> he doth not ſay <hi>let it not be,</hi> but <hi>let it not reigne.</hi> Sinne when it is <hi>mortified,</hi> is like a dead King that can call no more Parliaments: but a man may doe for him what he liſteth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſtrength lieth in the duſt. If Chriſt be in you ſaith the Apoſtle, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is dead becauſe of ſinne, but the ſpirit is life for righteouſneſſe ſake. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 10. Againe, if a man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of Chriſts; now if Chriſt be in you, the bodie is <hi>dead,</hi> if you conſider the bodie as it hath relation unto ſinne.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:121624:157"/> plaine there is no life of Chriſt to be had ſo long as you retaine your ſinnes, and therefore ſinne muſt be <hi>mortified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>becauſe Chriſt is a Saviour,</hi> and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> hence he is called Jeſus <hi>Math.</hi> 1. 21. for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes; if therefore Chriſt doe not ſave thee from thy ſinnes, and if by the power of Chriſt thou <hi>mortifie</hi> not thy ſinnes, and give them a deadly blow, aſſure thy ſelfe he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a Jeſus unto thee. It is true indeede Chriſt dyed for ſinners, but it was not to let them goe on in ſinne; and therefore if thou goe on in ſinne, it is for thy <hi>damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and not for thy <hi>ſalvation;</hi> for he will firſt ſave thee from thy <hi>ſinnes,</hi> or elſe he will never ſave thee from <hi>hell:</hi> ſo then conſider if thy ſinnes <hi>beare ſway</hi> in thee; if they doe, then know thou art delivered up unto the power of thy ſinnes, and to everlaſting darkeneſſe. For Chriſt is the true Phyſitian of the ſoule: and you know that a <hi>Phyſician</hi> doth not bring a potion to put it unto deaths mouth to kill death, and ſo to ſave the ſicke perſon alive: no, but he putteth it into the ſicke mans mouth to kill the <hi>ill humours</hi> that are in his bodie, that ſo he might not fall into the hands of death: ſo Chriſt came not to quench the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:121624:158"/> flames of hell by his ſpirituall Phyſicke, but to let his Phyſicke fall upon the heart and ſoule of man to ſave him from hell. Therefore unleſſe the bloud of Chriſt doe <hi>mortifie</hi> thy ſinnes, and crucifie thy luſts, there is no hope ever to get Chriſt to ſave thee from hell and everlaſting damnation. This is a true ſaying ſaith the Apoſtle and worthy to be received, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. This is a faithfull ſaying, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men like it well indeede: For ſaith the drunkard, I am a wicked man, yet Chriſt came to ſave me. The whoremonger ſaith I am an uncleane perſon: yet Chriſt came to ſave me. The ſwearer will ſay, Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, and therefore I hope he will ſave me to. No, no: Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, that is ſuch as were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but <hi>now</hi> are none: they have and doe repent. Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (ſaith the Apoſtle) whereof I am cheife. I was a blaſphemer, &amp; a perſecuter, but <hi>now</hi> I am not. Hence then is the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> ſaying, Chriſt came to ſave ſinners not ſtill ſinning. No, before, <hi>Paul</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, a perſecuter, and lived in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and unbeleife: but now the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was wonderfully
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:121624:158"/> abundant through faith and love towards him: ſo that the grace of God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to draw men out of blindneſſe and ignorance: therefore to ſay that Chriſt came to ſave ſuch as live in their ſinnes of drunkenneſſe, prophaneſſe or uncleaneſſe, is a <hi>rotten</hi> ſaying: and this onely is the faithfull ſaying that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners in whom the <hi>power</hi> of ſinne is broken: therefore if ever we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>looke to have <hi>benefitte</hi> or intereſt by Chriſt we muſt <hi>mortifie</hi> our earthly members.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe <hi>it is impoſsible for</hi>

                     <hi>ſinne and grace to live and ſubſiſt in one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi> it is impoſſible that they ſhould ever ſtand together, and be in a man at one and the <hi>ſame time:</hi> it cannot be that one and the ſame creature can have the life of a <hi>ſwine</hi> and the life of a <hi>man:</hi> for if he have the ſoule of a <hi>ſwine,</hi> he cannot have the ſoule of a <hi>man:</hi> for they are two <hi>contrary</hi> diſtinct lives: and where the one is, the other cannot be. It is like hot water and cold: if it be cold, it cannot be hot; if it be hot; it cannot be cold. Even ſo, the life of <hi>ſinne,</hi> and the life of <hi>grace</hi> are two <hi>contraries:</hi> and therefore they that walke in their ſinnes, walke contrary to God. Now the Lord ſaith, if you walke
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:121624:159"/> 
                     <hi>contrary</hi> to me, I will walke contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. and two <hi>contraries</hi> we know cannot goe together. He that walks in ſinne, walks <hi>contrary</hi> unto God: but he that goes on in the waies of <hi>grace,</hi> he walks towards God. Now, it is impoſſible to walke towards <hi>Dover</hi> and towards <hi>London</hi> at one and the ſame time: for every ſteppe he goeth forward to the one, it carries him backward from the other: ſo then if ever we will have the life of <hi>grace,</hi> we muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our ſinnes; as it was with the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David, Sauls</hi> houſe grew <hi>weaker,</hi> and <hi>Davids ſtronger;</hi> ſo muſt it be with <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> as grace growes ſtronger, ſo ſinne muſt grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: as grace goes up, ſo ſinne muſt goe downe; And as <hi>Saul</hi> told <hi>David</hi> he would not give him <hi>Michal</hi> his daughter to wife, unleſſe he brought unto him an hundred fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> skinnes of the <hi>Philiſtins;</hi> Even ſo the Lord ſaith that he will not <hi>marry</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto any ſoule, unleſſe he bring the fore-skinne of every <hi>luſt:</hi> he muſt <hi>circumciſe</hi> the fore-skinne of his pride, of his covetouſneſſe, of his prophaneſſe: this muſt be the offering and condition of marriage unto Chriſt; even the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>heart,</hi> and the mortification of all the <hi>corruptions.</hi>

Suppoſe a wicked man ſhould enter into heaven, it is impoſſible that he ſhould delight in heaven, if he were there. You will thinke this a ſtrange point: but give me leave to explaine it a little; I ſay that a wicked man if he were in heaven, he could finde no delight there. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, take a beaſt, for ſo is every man by his owne knowledge, in regard of the life of grace, as ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> though a man take an Oxe or an Aſſe, and bring him unto the Kings table, and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him all the delicates which appertaine unto Kings: let him have a dinner before him that coſt an hundred pounds: yet he had rather be in the fields among his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes eating graſſe: or ſet a Crowne of gold upon a beaſts head, he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, but caſt it off into the mire: for ſo long as the beaſt is not transformed and made capable of the honour that is in a man, he cannot conceive of the pleaſures and delights that doe belong unto man: Even ſo let a wicked man enjoy all the glory of heaven, and what will he ſay?

Now if a wicked man were there, what would he ſay? ſurely he would ſay they are all Puritans, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure it.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:121624:160"/> in compariſon of that which ſhall be. Here we doe but as it were <hi>peepe</hi> into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: now then if this be ſo <hi>tedious</hi> that wicked men cannot endure it, how will they like to be in a place where there is <hi>perfection</hi> of all graces, where there ſhall be nothing but prayſing God for ever and ever? Sure as I am the devill was once in heaven, and he caſt himſelfe out from thence: God did not though he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and God would have done it, had he not beene gone, as ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> verſe 6.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>ſuppoſe the ſinne mortified doe</hi>

                     <hi>not riſe againe; yet if we goe not on in the way of mortification, there will ariſe another ſinne in the roome of it.</hi> Sinne is like the Monſter <hi>Hydra;</hi> cut off one head, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will riſe up in its roome; Even ſo it is in the bodie of ſinne; therefore thou muſt <hi>dayly</hi> mortifie it, or elſe it will grow again.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:121624:164"/> There is a Hiſtory that ſpeaks of a Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree that grew in a ſtone wall, and all meanes was uſed to kill it; they cut off the branches and it grew againe; they cut downe the bodie and it grew againe; they cut it up by the root and ſtill it lived, and grew, untill they pulled downe the <hi>ſtone wall.</hi> Even ſo it is with ſinne; lopp off the branches, it lives; cut downe the body, it will not die: digg up the rootes, and it will ſtill revive, and will never leave growing untill God pull downe <hi>the ſtone wall</hi> of this our earthly Tabernacle, and lay it in the duſt, and therefore we muſt ſtill be <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe <hi>as we mortifie, ſo we</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>mortifie but in part;</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle in another caſe, we know but in part &amp;c. ſo may we ſay of this dutie, we mortifie but <hi>in part;</hi> as we ſay of a man breathing out his laſt breath, he is adying, but not quite dead; ſo we may ſay of ſinne, though it lie ſprawling upon the ground, yet it is not dead, the laſt gaſpe is not paſt. Nay, it may be ſinne is more ſtriving in the heart of a child of God <hi>converted,</hi> then it was <hi>before converſion.</hi> As an Oxe or an Aſſe when they have their deaths blow, will laſh and ſtruggle more <hi>then,</hi> then they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:121624:164"/> did in all their life time before; but this is nothing but the panges of death, being giving up their laſt breath. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, that the fleſh <hi>luſteth</hi> againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. So that they could not doe what they would verſe 17. as if he ſhould ſay ſinne is ſo <hi>mortified</hi> that it hath his <hi>deaths</hi> wound in thee; elſe thou canſt not be the child of God; yea <hi>ſuch</hi> a deaths wound as it cannot poſſible recover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                  <p>If a man that hath received his <hi>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:121624:165"/> it will downe at the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may know whether we<note place="margin">Marks.</note> have <hi>mortified</hi> our ſinnes or no, let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe markes following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>they that have mortifyed their</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>ſinnes, live in the contrary graces.</hi> Hence it is that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, that they worke no iniquitie, but walke in thy pathes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 3. Firſt, they crucifie all their ſinnes, they doe no iniquitie; Secondly as they doe no iniquitie, ſo they take up all the waies of God, contrarie to that iniquitie as they <hi>give up all</hi> the waies of ſinne, ſo they <hi>take up all</hi> the waies of Grace; they walke in all Gods waies. So that here is the queſtion, if a man giving over his<note place="margin">Note.</note> ſinnes, doe take up <hi>all</hi> the graces contrarie to thoſe ſinnes. This is a rule in Divinity that <hi>Grace takes not away nature, that is, Grace comes not to take away a mans affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but to take them up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a man be ſubject unto <hi>anger,</hi> when he is a little moved, Grace comes not to take away his anger, but to take it up from a worldly thing, and to ſet it againſt <hi>ſinne</hi> which is truly evill, that ſo he may be angrie and not ſinne. Grace comes to <hi>qualifie</hi> his anger, and to take it from the waies of ſinne, and to ſet it upon Gods wayes.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:121624:165"/>
                  <p>Againe, a man is ſubject to be <hi>merry;</hi> Grace comes to temper him, not to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his mirth, but to ſet it upon a right object, as to delight in <hi>God,</hi> to be merrie in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to rejoice in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> in his <hi>children,</hi> and in all the waies of <hi>grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another is given to <hi>impatiency;</hi> Grace comes not to take away his impatiencie, but to ſet his impatience againſt his ſinnes; ſo that when he ſees his <hi>ſinnes,</hi> he ſhall not be able to endure them, but his ſoule will <hi>groane</hi> for them, and his heart will <hi>riſe</hi> againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Another is given to <hi>revenge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> now Grace comes and takes him away from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on his neighbour, to be revenged on his <hi>ſinnes;</hi> ſo that with the Apoſtle we may call <hi>revenge</hi> a peice of <hi>Repentance;</hi> therefore this is a <hi>true</hi> triall whether our ſinnes be <hi>mortified,</hi> if our affections be <hi>taken</hi> away from the waies of ſinne, and <hi>faſt ſet</hi> upon the waies of Grace and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>if a man be mortifyed indeed</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>and in truth, then he is dead unto every ſinne;</hi> if a man be <hi>killed,</hi> he is dead in <hi>every</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; ſo if a man be <hi>dead</hi> to ſinne, no ſinne can ever <hi>raigne</hi> in him; not <hi>one</hi> luſt nor
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:121624:166"/> boſome ſinne, no not the ſinne of his <hi>trade, no</hi> corruption though never ſo deare, though it be the ſinne of his <hi>right hand,</hi> or <hi>right eye,</hi> yet it can never have dominion over him, if he be <hi>dead</hi> to ſinne; therefore if a man <hi>live</hi> in any one ſinne or ſweet luſt whatſoever, he is a <hi>dead</hi> man and hath not one jot of Grace; if there be but <hi>one</hi> knowne iniquitie in a man, that he <hi>lives and dies in without Repentance,</hi> that <hi>one</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie ſhall kill him to the pit of Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>The Schoolemen ſay that if a Sow doe but wallow in one mirie or dirtie hole, ſhe is fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hie; ſo if a ſoule wallow but in one ſinne, it is abhominable. If a man <hi>ſtab</hi> himſelfe but with <hi>one</hi> knife ſo that he <hi>die,</hi> he is as truly <hi>killed</hi> as was <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> who ſtabbed himſelfe with <hi>three and twenty knives.</hi> So if a man ſhould be free from an hundred diſeaſes, and ſhould die of <hi>one,</hi> what would it benefit him to be free from the <hi>reſt</hi> in reſpect of his life? ſurely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. That man that hath his pride, his Covetouſneſſe, his uſurie, hatred, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, deriding of Gods people, all theſe being dead in him; yet if <hi>ſelfe-love</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity &amp;c.</hi> be not <hi>dead</hi> in him, <hi>theſe</hi> argue his caſe to be <hi>nought;</hi> he is not yet qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:121624:166"/> for Chriſt; for there is no <hi>mortification</hi> at all in him.</p>
                  <p>There be many ſweet meanes to allure us unto <hi>mortification,</hi> but time will not permit us to ſpeake of them; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this let every man take notice of, that ſo long as he <hi>liveth</hi> in ſinne, he is altogether unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſaith, we know that the Law is not given unto a righteous man, but for the lawleſſe and diſobedient, for the ungodly and for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for the unholy and prophane, and whatſoever is contrarie to wholeſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; the Law is for ſuch men: But the <hi>firſt</hi> Doctrine of the Goſpell of Chriſt, is, <hi>Repent</hi> of thy ſinnes, deny thine owne wayes, take up Chriſts Croſſe, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lambe whereſoever he goes. Here the Kingdome of Heaven is laid open to all the world; Let mens miſeries be what they can be, and although their ſinnes be never ſo <hi>great,</hi> Chriſt commeth to <hi>redeeme</hi> them; yea though they have a whole Hell of ſinne in them, yet if they have a heart to entertaine Chriſt, his Grace is ſo rich and al ſufficient, that it will ſave every man that <hi>entertaineth</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>There is a Proclamation openly made in the Market place, Hoe every one that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:121624:167"/> thirſteth, come unto the waters, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 3. As if he ſhould ſay, Hoe, every one that hath a minde to Chriſt, come and have him; every one that hungers and thirſteth after Chriſt, let his ſinnes be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo <hi>great,</hi> and the number never ſo <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> here is <hi>hue and cry</hi> after him; Come unto the waters; He ſaith not come unto the <hi>water,</hi> but, <hi>waters;</hi> not a little low brooke or ſtreame, which is not able to waſh away all his ſinnes, but there is an Ocean of <hi>waters</hi> indefinitely; <hi>waters</hi> in the plurall number, declaring the fulneſſe and ſufficiencie to cleanſe the moſt <hi>leprous</hi> ſoule, be he never ſo much ſtained with corruption. It is ſaid by the Prophet <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah,</hi> that the Lord will ſend unto his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Saviours, verſe</hi> 21. not in the ſingular number, but <hi>Saviours</hi> in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; not that there were moe Chriſts then <hi>one;</hi> but to manifeſt the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of Chriſt, he is a <hi>rich</hi> Chriſt, <hi>full of Salvation</hi> for all them that come unto him; Therefore if there be any man that <hi>mournes</hi> and <hi>laments</hi> for his ſinnes, let him <hi>come;</hi> If there be any <hi>poore</hi> ſoule that is <hi>loaded</hi> with the weight of his iniquities, let him <hi>come</hi> unto Chriſt and <hi>welcome;</hi> for there is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine laide open for <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:121624:167"/> to waſh in: but let him know upon <hi>what</hi> termes he muſt come, if ever he meane to have <hi>Salvation</hi> by Chriſt; obſerve the ſtrict <hi>Conditions,</hi> and walke by the ſtrait rule of Chriſt: he muſt <hi>reſolve</hi> with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe come what will come, to <hi>ſtand</hi> or to <hi>fall</hi> with Chriſt; delivering up <hi>all</hi> his luſts and corruptions at his Command, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he calls for them; he muſt not part ſtakes with Chriſt to delude him; but he muſt be true and faithfull unto him; he muſt <hi>wholy deny himſelfe,</hi> and lie downe before Chriſt to let Chriſt doe what he will with him, and theſe <hi>onely</hi> are the termes he muſt expect Heaven upon; and <hi>thus doing,</hi> he may have <hi>Salvation</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the deſire of his ſoule.</p>
